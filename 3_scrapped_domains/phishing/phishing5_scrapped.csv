www.mapausesophro.net,1,fr,25,455,"Ma Pause Sophro : Sophrologue à Dunkerque - Séances de Sophrologie Qui suis-je ? La sophrologie Les accompagnements Les séances et tarifs Contact & Rendez-vous Partenaires Suivre Qui suis-je ? Notre mode de vie génère tout un tas d’émotions, du stress… Il nous faut toujours faire mieux, plus vite… sans pour autant avoir de retour positif ni de satisfaction. Comme chacun d’entre nous, j’ai été submergée par tout cela à un moment donné. J’ai été éprouvée par la vie, j’ai subi le stress au travail, j’ai soutenu des proches malades, je les ai accompagnés en me sentant souvent démunie. Aide-soignante depuis quinze années, j’ai toujours évolué dans le domaine de la relation d’aide. J’ai exercé à domicile et en structure, en équipe et de façon plus ou moins individuelle. A 37 ans, j’ai décidé de m’orienter vers la sophrologie, une nouvelle manière de concevoir cette relation d’aide, et de donner une nouvelle orientation, un sens, à ma vie. Formée à cette méthode à l’IFS (Institut de Formation à la Sophrologie Aliotta), me voici aujourd’hui. Suivre La sophrologie La sophrologie est une méthode psycho-corporelle, non tactile, qui vise l’harmonie du corps et de l’esprit. Initialement destinée à un usage thérapeutique, la sophrologie s’est ensuite orientée vers le développement personnel. Accessible à tous, elle repose sur la pratique de différents exercices de relaxation dynamique, basés sur des contractions et relâchements musculaires, de respiration, ainsi que des exercices de visualisation positive. Conçue sous différentes influences thérapeutiques (l’hypnose, la neurologie, l’auto-suggestion…), orientales (le yoga, le zen japonais…) et philosophique (phénoménologie), la sophrologie s’inscrit dans les thérapies brèves ( 8 à 12 semaines) et permet à chacun de trouver ses propres ressources pour faire face à ses problématiques. Un seul outil : ma voix. Je vous propose d’être votre guide, de vous accompagner lors de ce cheminement et de vous aider à révéler vos capacités. Ce diaporama illustre parfaitement la progression d’un accompagnement. Initialement chargé, le ciel se dégage petit à petit pour laisser place à la quiétude et à la sérénité. Confidentialité En tant que sophrologue, je vous garantis la confidentialité de nos échanges, une écoute bienveillante, l’adaptabilité… Adhérente à la Chambre Syndicale de Sophrologie, je respecte un code de déontologie que vous pouvez consultez librement sur leur site. Les accompagnements sophrologiques Aujourd’hui pleinement reconnue par les différentes instances institutionnelles, la sophrologie vous permet d’atteindre divers objectifs qui peuvent être regroupés en quatre grandes catégories : L'amélioration du quotidien pour retrouver un sommeil de qualité, être plus serein au travail… La préparation mentale pour préparer un événement précis, comme un examen, un accouchement, une compétition… L'accompagnement d'un traitement médical chimiothérapie, radiothérapie, suites post-opératoires d’une intervention chirurgicale, rééducation… L'accompagnement d'un comportement pathologique Sevrage, troubles alimentaires… NB : dans ces deux derniers cas , la sophrologie est un support. En aucun cas elle ne peut se substituer à un accompagnement médical. La sophrologie vous place au centre de la méthode. Vous êtes le principal acteur de votre réussite. Je m’engage à vous donner tous les outils pour que vous puissiez vous mettre à l’écoute e vous-même, et vous permettre de trouver les ressources qui vous sont nécessaires. Les séances de sophrologie Suivez l’actualité de Ma Pause Sophro sur sa page Facebook , notamment pour connaître le programme des prochaines ballades sophrologiques. Je vous propose mes services à domicile, en entreprise ou en extérieur. Séance individuelle (1h) D’une durée d’environ une heure, elle se compose d’un premier temps d’échange, d’un temps réservé à la pratique des différents exercices de relaxation associés à des exercices de respiration et de visualisation positive, et d’un dernier temps d’échange. Tarif : 50 euros (certaines mutuelles prennent en charge tout ou partie de la séance). Séance collective D’une durée variant de 45 min à 1h15, elle cible un objectif commun, préalablement défini, et s’articule de la même façon qu’une séance individuelle. Elles sont groupées par sessions de quatre de sorte à être efficace. Tarif : 15 euros/personne/séance (minimum de 4 personnes).

It was registered as a non-profit social welfare organization, by the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies of Bangladesh on 29th November 1993. From the very beginning of its journey, HDF is working with an endeavor to promote welfare of the poor and provide assistance for the distressed through social welfare steps, especially in the field of education. The core programme of the Foundation is Talent Assistance Scheme (TAS), a brainchild of late Alamgir M.A. Kabir, the founder chairman of the Foundation. TAS is directed with the aim of providing financial support in the form of interest-free loan to financially disadvantaged but meritorious students, mostly from rural areas. Every year 60 students, 30 girls and 30 boys, from the level of HSC first year are offered the award of interest-free loan. The assistance continues till the completion of their graduation/post graduation degree without any break. The members are also provided with donations for books and dresses. Another major programme of the Foundation is Rural School Library Enrichment Programme (RUSLEP) . The goal of the project is to build up libraries in rural schools with a good stock of suitable books, other than the prescribed text books; and to expose the students to the domain of education and enlightenment in which they are considerably disadvantaged compared to their fellow students of urban background. HDF is also implementing projects in various sectors through partner organizations in different parts of the country.

Seit Ã¼ber 25 Jahren beschÃ¤ftigen wir uns mit qualitÃ¤tiv hochwertigen Domainnamen und verwalten ein exclusives Portfolio an Keyword-Domains. Get Started! Warum mann relevante Keyword-Domains besitzen sollte Suchmaschinenoptimierung (SEO) Keyword-Domains kÃ¶nnen einen positiven Einfluss auf das Ranking in Suchmaschinen haben. Wenn die Domain ein relevantes Keyword enthÃ¤lt, erhÃ¶ht dies die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass die Webseite bei Suchanfragen, die dieses Keyword enthalten, weiter oben in den Suchergebnissen erscheint. Dies kann zu mehr organischem Traffic fÃ¼hren. Markenbekanntheit und Erinnerungswert Keyword-Domains sind oft einprÃ¤gsamer und leichter zu merken. Wenn die Domain das Produkt oder die Dienstleistung beschreibt, die angeboten wird, kÃ¶nnen sich potenzielle Kunden die URL einfacher merken und wiederfinden. Dies trÃ¤gt zur Markenbekanntheit und -wiedererkennung bei. Zielgerichteter Traffic Eine Domain, die das gesuchte Keyword enthÃ¤lt, zieht tendenziell Besucher an, die spezifisch an diesem Thema oder Produkt interessiert sind. Dies fÃ¼hrt zu zielgerichteterem Traffic, was die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Conversions (z.B. KÃ¤ufen, Anfragen, Registrierungen) erhÃ¶ht. VertrauenswÃ¼rdigkeit und AutoritÃ¤t Keyword-Domains kÃ¶nnen dazu beitragen, sofort Vertrauen bei potenziellen Kunden aufzubauen. Wenn die Domain den Eindruck vermittelt, dass die Webseite eine AutoritÃ¤t auf dem Gebiet ist, das im Keyword beschrieben wird, steigt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Besucher die Seite als vertrauenswÃ¼rdig einstufen und lÃ¤nger darauf verweilen.

mail.banklogin.duckdns.org,1,en,0,69,"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: /etc/apache2/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to start/stop the service use systemctl start apache2 and systemctl stop apache2 , and use systemctl status apache2 and journalctl -u apache2 to check status. system and apache2ctl can also be used for service management if desired. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file outside of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to their respective packages, not to the web server itself."

Keinen Stress vor der Kamera? Aber wie? Dass, das ganze auch wirklich perfekt wird, muss es möglichst natürlich wirken. Man merkt ein falsches Lachen relativ schnell. Ist die Nervosität dennoch da, ist dies ebenfalls kein Problem. Unser Kamerateam kennt genug Tricks auch hier weiter zu helfen. Ihre Hochzeitsgäste sollten auch informiert werden, dass bei der Hochzeit fotografiert und gefilmt wird, damit sich auch jeder darauf einstellen kann. Beim Paarshooting sollten möglichst wenig Personen dabei sein. Kooperation mit anderen Fotografen Nicht selten kommt es vor, dass bereits ein anderer Fotograf oder Videograf gebucht wurde. Um eine Zusammenarbeit möglichst einfach zu halten, möchten wir vorher Kontakt aufbauen, damit alles aufeinander abgestimmt werden kann. Einfach uns den Kontakt weiterleiten, den Rest klären wir. Vorbereitung Wetter × Schlechtes Wetter? Was dann? Man kann eine Hochzeit noch so planen, doch das Wetter kann man leider nicht beeinflussen. Was also, wenn es Schlechtwetter gibt? Ihr müsst euch in keinster Weise Sorgen machen. Unser Team ist auf alle Wetterbedingungen eingestellt. Stimmungsvolle Aufnahmen kann man auch ohne blauem Himmel und Sonnenschein machen. Wetter Ablauf × Kontaktaufnahme Am einfachsten ist es, wenn ihr uns per E-Mail oder über das Kontaktformular kontaktiert. Hierbei ist es wichtig Name, Telefonnummer und den Hochzeitstermin anzugeben. Das wäre auch schon alles, danach melden wir uns. Wie lange wird der Fotograf oder Videograf vor Ort sein? Solange ihr uns braucht, sind wir da. Ihr könnt jederzeit das Paket, das ihr gebucht habt, verlängern. Gibt es Anweisungen während wir fotografiert und gefilmt werden? So gut wie keine. Wir legen Wert auf Natürlichkeit während der Hochzeit. Wir arbeiten, wenn möglich, im Hintergrund. So entstehen auch die besten und schönsten Aufnahmen. Lediglich beim Brautpaarshooting werden wir euch entsprechend anweisen. Wie bekommen wir den Film? Das Gesamtpaket erhaltet ihr auf einem USB-Stick. Auf Anfrage können wir euch auch eine DVD und D-Cover zusenden. Ablauf Kamera × Ausfall der Kamera Es kommt nicht oft vor, dass unsere Technik ausfällt, dennoch kann dieser seltene Fall eintreten. Auf so etwas sind wir jedoch gut vorbereitet. Wir benutzen dann einfach unser Backup-System. Welche Technik wird benutzt? Hochzeitsfoto & Hochzeitsvideo besitzt eine große Auswahl an Kameras, vorwiegend fotografieren und filmen wir mit DSLR-Kameras und Full-HD-Kameras. Kamera Bearbeitung × Wann wird alles fertig sein? Sobald die Hochzeit vorbei ist, werden die Daten gesichert und von uns am Schnittplatz bearbeitet. Natürlich könnt ihr auch hier eure Wünsche und Vorstellungen äußerern, wir versuchen diese dann so gut wie möglich umzusetzen. Welche Lieder werden für das Video verwendet? Da jeder einen anderen Musikgeschmack hat, dürft ihr auch hier ein Wörtchen mitreden und die für euch passende Musik auswählen. Bearbeitung Schwebekamera × Wollt ihr einen 2. Kameramann mit Schwebestativ und Slider. So können wir Ihnen ein Hochzeitsvideo im Hollywood-Format liefern.

Preise & Nebenkosten Tipps & Tricks × Begleitung zum Paarshooting? Natürlich sind wir auch beim Paarshooting dabei, sollte es sich zeitlich nicht ausgehen, ist es nach Absprache möglich, an einem anderen Tag das Shooting durchzuführen. Braucht man einen Ablaufplan?

Cette technologie a ouvert de belles perspectives créatives et professionnelles, permettant d'obtenir des points de vue uniques et des angles de prise de vue auparavant impossibles ou extrêmement coûteux à réaliser. De plus, les drones peuvent atteindre des endroits inaccessibles aux hélicoptères ou aux avions, offrant ainsi des possibilités infinies pour la capture d'images. Basée à Rognonas, près d'Avignon, notre entreprise est spécialisée en prestation de photographie avec drone en basse altitude et intervient sur une vaste zone couvrant les régions : Provence, la Côte d'Azur et le Languedoc. Nous intervenons dans les départements des Bouches-du-Rhône, Vaucluse, Var, Gard, Hérault, Ardèche, Drôme et Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, tout en étant disponibles pour des missions spéciales au-delà de ces régions si nécessaire. Et ceci en tout lieux : centre ville, zone industrielle, zone Seveso, parc naturel ... Que vous soyez un professionnel, une collectivité ou un particulier, nous sommes là pour transformer vos idées en réalité visuelle dans le respect de la réglementation. Pourquoi opter pour un photographe professionnel spécialisé en prise de vue aérienne par drone ? Le recours à un photographe professionnel spécialisé dans la prise de vue par drone présente de nombreux avantages indéniables : Expertise technique et artistique Un photographe professionnel maîtrise parfaitement les aspects techniques de son métier. Il est expert non seulement dans le pilotage des drones, mais aussi dans les réglages complexes des appareils photos et caméras embarqués. Cette double compétence permet de capturer des images d'une qualité exceptionnelle, que ce soit en termes de netteté, d'exposition ou de composition. Notre œil exercé et notre sens artistique nous permet de créer des images qui racontent une histoire, transmettent une émotion ou mettent en valeur un sujet vue du ciel de manière optimale. Cette expertise est le fruit de nombreuses années d'expérience et d'une formation continue. Connaissance approfondie de la réglementation La photo aérienne par drone en France est soumise à une réglementation aérienne stricte qui évolue régulièrement. Notre entreprise est parfaitement au fait de ces règles et dispose de toutes les autorisations nécessaires pour exercer son activité en toute légalité dans l'espace aérien français, nous faisions déjà des reportages aériens par ballon captif depuis 2008 bien avant l'arrivée des drones ! En tant que pilote de drone professionnel, nous nous occupons d'obtenir les autorisations spécifiques pour votre reportage et nous nous assurons que toutes les normes de sécurité sont respectées, ainsi que le respect de la vie privée. Cette connaissance approfondie de la réglementation vous protège de tout risque juridique lié à l'utilisation de drones. Suivi de chantier vision globale de vos chantiers au fil du temps Equipement professionnel Nous utilisons du matériel photographique haut de gamme, régulièrement mis à jour pour garantir des résultats optimaux. Nos drones sont équipés de caméras haute résolution capables de capturer des images de haute qualité, même dans des conditions de luminosité difficiles. Nous avons acquis également au cours de nombreuses années d'expérience un solide savoir faire en terme de post production. En complément de nos drones, nous utilisons également un mât télescopique de 17 mètres entièrement piloté depuis le sol. Cet outil polyvalent nous permet de réaliser des prises de vue originales dans des espaces confinés ou lorsque l'utilisation d'un drone n'est pas possible, comme pour des prises de vue en intérieur, dans des zones interdites ou de nuit. ... des angles de vues inédits Les avantages uniques de la photographie par drone Une flexibilité inégalée pour des vues aériennes spectaculaires Le drone offre une flexibilité que peu d'autres technologies peuvent égaler. Capable de voler jusqu'à 120 mètres de hauteur (hauteur maximale réglementaire, possibilité d'aller plus haut si besoin par dérogation), il peut capturer des images grandioses en très haute résolution, révélant des détails invisibles depuis le sol. Les drones modernes sont équipés de caméras sophistiquées capables de produire des photos et des vidéos d'une qualité exceptionnelle, même dans des conditions de lumière difficiles. Que ce soit pour l'immobilier, l'architecture, l'industrie, chantier BTP, patrimoine ou le tourisme, le drone permet de saisir des perspectives nouvelles et originales. Par exemple, dans l'immobilier, des images aériennes peuvent mettre en valeur les dimensions et l'emplacement d'une propriété d'une manière qu'aucune photo au sol ne pourrait reproduire. De même, pour les sujets architecturaux, les vues aériennes permettent de comprendre l'intégration d'un bâtiment dans son environnement, en capturant ses lignes et ses volumes sous des angles inédits. Une technologie au service de la sécurité et de la précision En tant que droniste professionnel la sécurité est notre priorité absolue dans toutes nos opérations de photographie aérienne. Nous respectons strictement les réglementations en vigueur, notamment en ce qui concerne les altitudes de vol et les zones où l'utilisation de drones est autorisée. Pour chaque reportage le nécessitant nous faisons une déclaration préfectorale lors d'intervention en ville et toutes les demandes de vol spécifique au lieu du reportage. Zenith Photo est enregistré en tant exploitant déclaré et certifié auprès des services de la Direction Générale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), ce qui garantit que chaque mission est menée à bien en toute légalité et en toute sécurité. Nos drones sont tous enregistrés et sont des aéronefs homologués. De plus, la précision des drones modernes nous permet de photographier avec un niveau de détail impressionnant, tout en minimisant l'impact sur l'environnement. Les drones peuvent être utilisés pour des missions complexes, telles que l'inspection de structures, suivi de chantiers, ou la documentation de vastes étendues de terrain, sans les perturbations associées à d'autres méthodes de prise de vue aérienne, comme les hélicoptères ou les avions.

Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption.

Ekkor még nem tudtuk, hogy a közös fotózás iránti szenvedélyünkből egy életre szóló kaland lesz. Néhány éves alkalmazotti munkát követően úgy döntöttünk, hogy 1982-ben megalapítjuk a saját fényképész műtermünket, amely a Fókusz Fotó nevet kapta. Fotózásaink és szolgáltatásaink Fotózásaink és szolgáltatásaink Szolgáltatásunk azon kevesek közé tartozik, amely a felvétel elkészítésétől kezdve a bekeretezett fotóig, a kész ajándékig minden egy helyen történik. kapcsolatfelvétel Családi, gyermekfotózás A fotózás igénybevételéhez időpont foglalás szükséges, amit telefonon tudsz egyeztetni!

Grace taught me to trust a fresh thought would show up. It does. Grace’s calm and steady state of mind in her coach-approach modelled freshness, appreciation and joy. Her approach helped me consciously notice my state of mind. As a result she helped me unblock anxious energy and I took action with easeful, excited energy towards long held dreams, including a creative idea I’d been sitting on for some years. I’ve even gotten a website with sellable products up! It feels so…fun! I’ve been living more in feelings of presence, awe and abundance, and I’m hearing my inner guidance. I’m stepping into my fresh, new chapter! Thank you! Kelly Cowan “Finally found my sweet spot, so much more fulfilled and no longer living discouraged!” In coaching with Grace one of the most unexpected shifts I got was to stop being at the mercy of other people’s moods and opinions about me. I was often very impacted by my personal life and those around me to the point it affected my business. Through our work together I have turned this around to finally experience a sense of freedom in my personal life and to find my sweet spot, doing what lights me up! I seem to be able to work way more but it doesn’t feel like work at all, I feel so fulfilled. I experience way more energy nowadays and am able to run my business from a place of deep enjoyment and in a way that doesn’t sacrifice my role as a single mum. I can now see the longevity of what I have to offer clients and with that a deeper value has come through. Where I used to get caught up on things needing to be faster now I live discouragement proof and less at the mercy of urgent /dissatisfied thoughts. Nicki Byrne “There’s a fun, miraculous way of growing a coaching business.” My main aim in working together was around my coaching business. Before working with Grace I thought I had to do so much to get results, like continuously reach out to people, be on social media, do this course and that. There was a lot of activity, and though I had some clients, it was quite tiring. Working with Grace I had insights around how guided I have been in my life. That there is a life force working through me and always has. I remember as soon as I signed up with her, an old friend’s name came into my head. I called him and we had a 2 hour phone call – he was in a lot of fear and overwhelm. We did a coaching session and a few days later and he signed up for a 3 months coaching package! As Grace coached me I’ve noticed things like that all the time – money showing up, organizations wanting me to work with them, an effortless flow. I’ve seen something fresh about just being in my life, enjoying the richness of my life and trusting that guidance. Now I’m at a place where I’ve been able to make a living from coaching and earning what I used to earn in my job – which wasn’t the case before. Beyond that, it’s the deep sense of knowing myself, the impact I can have, and the energy that wants to be lived through me. That I can write poems, go on trips and that’s all a part of the business. That busyness doesn’t have to be a part of business. There’s a fun, miraculous way of growing a coaching business that is not only more enjoyable, it’s also way more effective! Dubem, UK “A profound sense of confidence into my life and business.” Grace entered my life during a challenging phase of transition in my business and personal life, and her coaching was truly transformative. Through her love and guidance, I rediscovered ease and inspiration … and regained my natural confidence. As I was feeling lost, Grace’s grounded and compassionate approach led me back to my true self, expanding my view of success to encompass rest, receiving and spiritual connection. Now, my business operates with more gentleness and divine guidance than ever before – infused with everyday miracles. I wholeheartedly recommend Grace to anyone who wants to build (or rebuild) their business or just be in life with ease, grace, and a touch of spiritual magic. Her guidance has helped me to revive the lightness and aliveness in me … and brought back a profound sense of confidence into my life and business. Shailia Stephens, MSc. “I’ve gone on to host my own retreats!” I got so lost in all the online stuff that I became very overwhelmed and disconnected from myself, then I found Grace and in our time together I feel I’ve come home to myself in a whole new way. I’ve experienced an innate confidence, clarity and grounded-ness that I never knew was possible . After attending her retreat in Italy I’m smiling from the inside out these days, feeling so connected to my business direction and how I can help my clients. I’ve gone on to leave a job, host my own retreats, sell my first ever 3 month package and now enjoy my business.

Dental implant, eksik dişlerin yerine konulması için kullanılan, çene kemiğine yerleştirilen yapay diş kökleridir. İmplantlar, titanyum gibi biyouyumlu malzemelerden yapılır ve doğal dişlerin fonksiyon ve görünümünü taklit eder. İmplant Tedavisi Kimler İçin Uygundur? Genel sağlık durumu iyi olan ve çene kemiği yeterli yoğunlukta olan her birey implant tedavisi için uygun aday olabilir. Ancak, spesifik durumlar için diş hekimi değerlendirmesi gereklidir. İmplant Tedavisi Ne Kadar Sürer? İmplant tedavisinin süresi, hastanın durumuna ve gerekli tedavi planına bağlı olarak değişiklik gösterebilir. Genellikle, implantın yerleştirilmesi ve iyileşme süreci birkaç ay sürebilir. İmplantların Ömrü Ne Kadardır? Doğru bakım ve düzenli diş hekimi kontrolleri ile dental implantlar ömür boyu kullanılabilir. İyi bir ağız hijyeni ve düzenli profesyonel temizlikler implantların ömrünü uzatır. İmplant Tedavisi Sırasında Ağrı Hissedilir mi? İmplant yerleştirilmesi genellikle lokal anestezi altında yapılır, bu nedenle işlem sırasında ağrı hissedilmez. Operasyon sonrasında hafif ağrılar olabilir, ancak bu ağrılar genellikle ağrı kesiciler ile kontrol altına alınabilir. İmplantların Bakımı Nasıl Yapılır? İmplantların bakımı, doğal dişlerin bakımıyla aynıdır. Günde en az iki kez dişlerin fırçalanması, diş ipi kullanımı ve düzenli diş hekimi kontrolleri, implantların sağlıklı kalması için gereklidir. İmplant Tedavisinin Maliyeti Nedir? İmplant tedavisinin maliyeti, hastanın durumuna, kullanılan malzemelere ve tedavi planına bağlı olarak değişiklik gösterebilir. Kesin bir maliyet bilgisi için diş hekimi ile görüşmek gereklidir. BioPort, Geistlich Biomaterials, Thommen Medical ve Southern Implants’ın Türkiye’de tek yetkili distribütörüdür.

Log In All Natural Mother Tasha Stevenson, Woman's Wellness Coach My Services About Me Hello and welcome! My name is Tasha and I am a Texas native. I am a wife and mother to four amazing humans. I have spent the last 20 years educating myself in woman’s studies; focused in the field of pregnancy, birthing and postpartum care. In 2014 after having my third child I was able to start a journey of guiding woman professionally. Using the many experiences learned from struggling through my own pregnancies, births and postpartum depression/anxiety I have spent the following years guiding woman through those same stages of their life. Being with woman during the most vulnerable part of life is a magical experience and I’m honored to be able to do it. In 2018 I attended classes through International Doula Institute for child birth educator, birth and postpartum doula as well as started the track to become IBCLC. In 2022 I became a certified Embodied Energetic Practitioner through Arcana Life. Adding that education has allowed me to be able to continue to coach woman well beyond pregnancy and postpartum through all of lives journeys. My passion to help others has extended to helping people navigate all the parts of life both past and present. Guiding people in managing all of life’s hardness. As well as combining my education and knowledge to help women in the throws of pregnancy and postpartum, juggling with the what's next when baby is no long a baby, women past child bearing age navigating finding who they are after raising their families. Additionally working with children struggling with finding their feelings and how to listen to their bodies. My greatest hope in this work is to help people find balance in their hearts, minds, body and souls.

Es wurde 51 Modelle Typ D und 54 vom Typ E gebaut, zusammen mit Vorserienmodellen insgesamt 105 Exemplare. Louis Chiron fuhr die Premiere in Silverstone, es folgten viele weitere Erfolge auf allen europäischen und US-Strecken. Die Produktion endete im September 1950 nachdem freistehende Kotflügel im Rennsport verboten wurden. Details Healey in Action Next Events More Restorations? Tipps & Tricks More Review Healey on road More Healey Silverstone Register Wir sammeln die verfügbaren Details über alle gebauten Healey Silverstones. Damit ermöglichen wir die Recherche für die individuelle Historie und schützen Originale vor Nachbauten. Unseren Freund Bernd Sgraja danken wir für seine jahrzehntelange Recherchearbeit. We collect the available details about all built Healey Silverstones. This allows us to search for individual history and protect originals from replicas. We thank our friend Bernd Sgraja for his decades of research. To Register Bernd Sgraja & Healey Silverstone Unser Freund Bernd Sgraja und seine Frau Dorothea Weingarten haben in vielen Jahren akribischer Recherche ein umfangreiches Register für alle Healey Silverstones aufgebaut. Dort sammelten sie für alle Exemplare die früheren Besitzer, Rennergebnisse, Umbauten, Farben, Registriernummern und Fotos. Nach dem plötzlichen Tod von Bernd 2018 übernahmen Connie und Hannes Rambold seine Arbeit und versuchen das Register auf aktuellem Stand zu halten.

We believe holistic development is key to lasting positive change. Access to quality education and economic empowerment creates a sustainable environment where children and families can thrive. That is why we are committed to empower the community through enhancing access to quality education, socioeconomic development, strengthening societal structures, and creating employment opportunities. Kibera slum, in Nairobi, Kenya, is Africa’s largest urban slum, housing over half a million people across just 2.5 square kilometers. Entire families live on less than $2 per day in densely crowded shanty houses, with no sanitation services, prevalent crime and high rates of HIV infection. We are a hand up (not a handout) organization dedicated to helping the children, youth, men and women from the most impoverished backgrounds through education as we believe it is the most effective tool in fighting the poverty that inflicts the residents of Kibera. With a good education in all its different forms, we believe people can go on to make a sustainable positive impact on their lives - and the lives of those around them. SUPPORT US Education sponsorship Providing access to high-quality high school and tertiary education to extremely needy children from impoverished backgrounds in the Kibera slum. Students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to get a well-paying job, which is the difference between a reasonably comfortable life and a harsh existence under poverty. LEARN MORE Youth Empowerment The project supports the youth of Kibera through hands-on skills through the Future ‘Poa’ project. The project focuses on digital literacy, tailoring, peanut butter production, and creative arts as avenues to impart the employable skills. The project aims at reducing the massive employment gap in the slum. LEARN MORE Economic Empowerment Since 2012, the project has provided socio-economic empowerment to the women of Kibera.Recently, the male counterparts have joined the project which is now implemented through the Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILC) project, which provides access to business training, microfinance and support for small business start-up and development. LEARN MORE Our Founder’s Story Through being gifted an education, Tommy was able to lift himself out of poverty. Now it is his mission to help others do the same. Growing up in the Kibera slum, Tommy was brought up in a family that was not able to pay for his high school education. Ultimately, Tommy gave up all hope of completing his high school education… until an encounter with an old Irish traveler changed the course of his life forever. Upon a brief introduction and meeting Tommy’s parents, the stranger offered to pay for his entire high school education. Tommy proceeded to university, after which he devoted his life to paying forward the gift of education to as many vulnerable children, youth, women, and men living under impoverished conditions in the Kibera slum. Tommy never got the stranger’s name, met him again nor had any form of contact with him. His hope is that by supporting as many people as he can through Mirror of Hope, he can continue to pay back the kindness he was once shown, creating new opportunities.

Ctrl + K 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 Powered by GitBook 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 Last updated 2 years ago What is 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 Addressed utilizing the essence of a fox, 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 is a digital currency wallet that is seemingly the most well known and trusted among crypto clients. It comes as a module that you can introduce on Chrome, Valiant, and Firefox web programs. MetaMask is a non-custodial cross-chain wallet that empowers you to store crypto resources in light of Ethereum, Binance Savvy Chain, Polygon, and other blockchains. Dissimilar to a bank or a wallet on a crypto trade, MetaMask isn't keen on controlling your assets or your exchanges. In this way, as long as you secure your wallet the correct way and own your confidential keys, just you will control your cash. Buy, store, send and swap tokens Available as a browser extension and as a mobile app, 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 equips you with a key vault, secure login, token wallet, and token exchange—everything you need to manage your digital assets. Explore blockchain apps MetaMask provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. You are always in control when interacting on the new decentralized web. It is likewise classified as a ""product wallet,"" implying that the point of interaction is associated with the web to empower specific functionalities on the web. This fundamentally further develops convenience while getting to blockchain applications (dApps) however it includes some significant downfalls. MetaMask: Prizes that Accompany Dangers Digital currencies and blockchains have more use cases than you might conceivably envision. Most are tracked down on decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) conventions. MetaMask was worked to work with these applications and lower the hindrances to passage for crypto clients. You can utilize your MetaMask qualifications to get to these administrations with one simple snap. Whenever you open a dApp or a DeFi convention, you can tap on the ""Interface"" button and utilize your MetaMask certifications to sign in on the stage. The following are a couple of things you can do utilizing MetaMask: Pull out credits from or loan your resources for an attractive interest Purchase, sell, exchange NFTs on commercial centers Play blockchain based games Begin yield cultivating Pursue NFT and digital currency airdrops In any case, likewise with any beneficial thing, utilizing MetaMask accompanies a few dangers. Anything associated with the web isn't completely secure, not even the public authority frameworks that suck in billions of dollars to keep up with elevated degrees of safety. The equivalent goes for 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 . It is associated with the web and accordingly passes on space for programmers to assault and take clients' assets. Your key to blockchain applications 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 is the leading self-custodial wallet. The safe and simple way to access blockchain applications and web3. Trusted by millions of users worldwide. To get to somebody's assets, a programmer can remotely introduce malware to get to the client's program and make changes to deplete the assets into their wallet. For instance, a Reddit client makes sense of here how a programmer hacked his framework to move 1.98 ETH worth roughly 5,000 bucks at the hour of keeping in touch with another wallet. The Redditor likewise added that a potential malware introduced in their framework changed any replicated crypto wallet address to an alternate one after sticking; this sort of trick takes advantage of visually impaired marking to get sufficiently close to your assets - this is the sort of thing all product wallet clients ought to know about. Last year in April, the authority MetaMask wallet of a crypto project called EasyFi got hacked, losing more than 75 million bucks worth of crypto resources. What's more, these assaults are ordinary since programmers don't have to straightforwardly get to your wallet. All things considered, they can fix your PC framework or simply your program to achieve the data they need to take your assets. Thus, even 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 prescribes its client to get an equipment wallet on the off chance that they own a lot of crypto. It makes sense then that the perfect balance is having the Web3 deftness of MetaMask, and the disconnected security of an equipment wallet - and here, we're telling you the very best way to accomplish that. Now is the ideal time to get set up! Priorities straight: Your 2-Minute MetaMask Set-up 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 is a program expansion viable with Chrome, Firefox, Daring and Edge, so the most effective way to begin is by guaranteeing you're utilizing a viable web program. Receive our Newsletter Sign up to receive updates and announcements Sign up From that point, find the MetaMask download interface through search and download the application to your program. You'll then confront a significant inquiry: make new wallet, or import existing wallet. Here, select to make new wallet. We'll make sense of why underneath. Endorse the following page: this connects with imparting information to MetaMask Make a secret word when incited on the page that follows: this will be your login qualification for each time you need to utilize MetaMask going ahead. On the following screen, you'll get the recuperation expression words for your MetaMask wallet. Whenever you've affirmed that you've seen and recorded this expression, your MetaMask set-up is finished. Which Recuperation Expression Do I utilize? You may be standing amazed right now what the thing that matters is between the MetaMask recuperation state and the one you got when you originally set up your Record gadget. The response is straightforward - each expression connects with a different arrangement of addresses on the blockchain. The thing that matters is that the Record recuperation state has never been uncovered on the web, while the 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 expression has. This is a significant weakness that all product wallets endure - your keys and seed state are completely created web-based inside the point of interaction, and as you most likely are aware, this leaves them open to hacks and spyware sent by means of your association. For this reason it is so vital for utilize a wallet that creates this information disconnected and keeps it there. In this cycle, we will tell you the best way to involve your Record Nano as your wallet, while utilizing MetaMask program augmentation as a delegate for cooperating with Web3. This actually intends that for you, the pertinent words remain your Record recuperation express. Ensure it's put away securely, you know the drill! Step by step instructions to Utilize MetaMask with your equipment wallet Now that you know the dangers, you might contemplate whether there's a way you can utilize MetaMask without blocking your security? Obviously, there is: by utilizing it couple with your equipment wallet. By and large, utilizing an equipment wallet, for example, Record Nano is the savviest and most secure method for putting away the confidential keys, which go about as confirmation of crypto resources you own. The Record Nano stores your confidential keys disconnected and ensures that nobody on the web can mess with them. That is the reason a blend of Record and 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 is viewed as the most secure and smoothest elective. Such a blend furnishes you with an actual U2F. Implying that you should actually interface your Nano wallet to your PC to sign and affirm each exchange mentioned through MetaMask. As you can figure, this makes the programmers' occupation very troublesome. This is the thing makes utilizing the blend of 𝗠𝗲𝘁å𝗺å𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 and Record so secure. To begin with, get yourself a Record equipment wallet to shield your confidential keys. Record gadgets accompany a product called Record Live (accessible on portable and work area), which is essentially what might be compared to the application store to the iphone, giving you a protected passage to all your crypto administrations and downloadable for nothing through this connection. Once in Record Live, make your Ethereum account by tapping on 'accounts' on the left hand side, then 'add an Ethereum account'. From that point onward, you can turn your Fiat ($,£,€, and so on) into Ethereum (Digital currency). For the greater part of you the most straightforward method for doing that will be through Wyre/Coinify on Record live. Next you will actually want to utilize the Ethereum account you made in Record Live on MetaMask from inside the security of your Record gadget. That drives us to our next unavoidable issue: how would you set up Metamask? How about we Get Associated! With that all unmistakable, how about we stroll through the means of how you can interface Record to MetaMask, to appreciate consistent exchanges while your keys stay altogether disconnected. Stage 1. Interface your Record Nano to your PC gadget utilizing a USB link. Likewise, open your MetaMask wallet in full screen on your program. You can do this by signing in with the secret phrase you just set up."

You can write articles, long mission statements, company policies, executive profiles, company awards/distinctions, office locations, shareholder reports, whitepapers, media mentions and other pieces of content that don’t fit into a shorter, more succinct space. Articles – Good topics for articles include anything related to your company – recent changes to operations, the latest company softball game – or the industry you’re in. General business trends (think national and even international) are great article fodder, too. Mission statements – You can tell a lot about a company by its mission statement. Don’t have one? Now might be a good time to create one and post it here. A good mission statement tells you what drives a company to do what it does. Company policies – Are there company policies that are particularly important to your business? Perhaps your unlimited paternity/maternity leave policy has endeared you to employees across the company. This is a good place to talk about that. Executive profiles – A company is only as strong as its executive leadership. This is a good place to show off who’s occupying the corner offices. Write a nice bio about each executive that includes what they do, how long they’ve been at it, and what got them to where they are.

This dormant volcanic mountain has 3 peaks, but only two are accessible. Mawenzi Peak is a technical one , where as Kibo Peak is not, hence most people when they talk about Climbing Kilimanjaro they talk about reaching the summit of Kibo Peak. The third peak is Shira, but doesnât exist any more due to further volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago. TANZANIA ROYAL Tour & Safaris Kilimanjaro Climbing Routes Lemosho Route 6-8 DAY Climbing + 2 DAYS IN A HOTEL Our favorite, this trail begins on the picturesque western side of the Mountain and offers stunning views on Shira plateau. Climbing Cost:from $1983 Lemosho Route Featuring captivating scenic vistas, pristine wildlife, excellent acclimatization opportunities and low traffic of climbers, Lemosho is our personal first favorite for reaching the roof of Africa. After a 4-hour long drive from Moshi to Londorossi Gate you'll find yourself on the western slope of Mt Kilimanjaro, from there the Route will take you to the world-famous Shira Plateau. That's where you'll embark on your adventure through all climate zones - from alpine meadows to eternal ice. The climb is smooth and gradual, featuring the highest Success Rate of all Routes on Kilimanjaro. Six, seven and eight-day programs are available, so you can choose depending on the amount of time at your disposal. Longer programs are always recommended over the shorter ones for better acclimatization. 6 and 7-day Lemosho programs start from a high-altitude drop-off: youâll be transferred to the elevation of 3,500 m/ 11,500 f by an off-road vehicle and start the hike from there. This is meant to maximize acclimatization transition -The higher you start, the easier your adaptation will be. â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ TANZANIA ROYAL Tour AND Safaris View Packages Lemosho Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro View Packages Machame Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro View Packages Marangu Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro View Packages Northern Circuit Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro View Packages Rongai Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro View Packages Umbwe Route Itinerary Kili Tour Kilimanjaro GREAT TANZANIA (MIGRATION MARA RIVER CROSSING) LUXURY Packages The annual wildebeest migration through the Serengeti and the Masai Mara attract visitors from around the world, who flock to the open plains to witness the largest mass movement of land mammals on the planet. More than a million animals make the seasonal journey to fresh pasture to the north, then the south, after the biannual rains. The sound of their thundering hooves, raising massive clouds of thick red dust, has become one of the legends of the Serengeti plains. The entire ecosystem thrives from the annual migration, from the lions and birds of prey that gorge themselves on the weak and the faltering to the gamut of hungry crocodiles that lie in patient wait at each river crossing for their annual feed. /Africa Rise Safaris CO LTD /ROYAL Tour The Serengeti National Park is one of worldâs greatest game parks. Meaning âendless plainsâ in the Maasai language, the Serengeti continues to be an ongoing source of inspiration to writers, filmmakers and photographers alike. It is Tanzaniaâs oldest game reserve and is world-famous for the role it plays in the annual Great Migration, when an estimated two million herbivores â mostly wildebeest â migrate from the Serengeti to Kenyaâs Masai Mara Game Reserve. Hundreds of thousands of animals die along the way and the drama of this epic seasonal journey is a gripping, deeply moving experience and a wonderful photographic subject.

All the big names of mainstream Tanzanian Safaris are located in the north. On a Northern Circuit Safari, travelers depart from Arusha. Lake Manyara National Park and Tarangire National Park are little more than three hours away and are often incorporated as part of a longer Safari. The most visited part of the Northern Circuit is the Ngorongoro Crater, where wildlife grazes and hunts in one of the largest volcanic craters in the world. The most visited part of the Northern Circuit is the Ngorongoro Crater, where wildlife grazes and hunts in one of the largest volcanic craters in the world. If you are traveling from December to April, the annual wildebeest migration in Serengeti National Park is definitely not to be missed. A longer trek through the Ngorongoro Crater Highlands is also a beautiful way to explore northern Tanzania at a leisurely pace. Day-trips from Arusha to Mt. Meru and the Momela Lakes, located in Arusha National Park, incorporate short forest hikes and canoeing trips as a break from standard vehicle game drives. Arusha National Park A popular day trip for visitors about to embark from the town of Arusha on longer Northern Circuit Safaris, Arusha National Park is a gem of varied ecosystems and has spectacular views of Mt. Meru, the crater that gives the region its name. The small national park includes the summit of Mt. Meru, the Momela Lakes, Ngurdoto Crater, and the lush forests that blanket its lower slopes. Game viewing around Momela Lakes is leisurely and while passing through the forest many visitors stop to search for troupes of rare Colobus monkeys. Ancient fig tree forests and crystal clear waters cascading from mountain streams are the attractions and pleasures of Arusha National Park. Tarangire National Park Tarangire National Park has some of the highest population density of elephants anywhere in Tanzania, and its sparse vegetation makes it a beautiful and special location. Located just a few hoursâ drive from the town of Arusha, Tarangire is a popular stop for Safaris travelling through the Northern Circuit on their way to Ngorongoro and the Serengeti. The park extends into two game controlled areas and the wildlife is allowed to move freely throughout. Before the rains, droves of gazelle, wildebeest, zebra, and giraffes migrate to Tarangire National Parkâs scrub plains where the last grazing land still remains. Tarangire offers unparalleled game viewing and has more elephants than any other park. Families play around the ancient trunks of baobab trees and strip acacia bark from the thorn trees for their afternoon meal. Lake Manyara National Park Located beneath the cliffs of the Manyara Escarpment, on the edge of the Rift Valley, Lake Manyara National Park offers varied ecosystems, incredible bird life, and breathtaking views. Located on the way to Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti, Lake Manyara National Park is well worth a stop in its own right. Its ground water forests, bush plains, baobab strewn cliffs, and algae-streaked hot springs offer incredible ecological variety in a small area, rich in wildlife and incredible numbers of birds. The alkaline soda of Lake Manyara is home to an incredible array of bird life that thrives on its brackish waters. Pink flamingo stoop and graze by the thousands, colourful specks against the grey minerals of the lake shore. Yellow-billed storks swoop and corkscrew on thermal winds rising up from the escarpment, and herons flap their wings against the sun-drenched sky. Even reluctant bird-watchers will find something to watch and marvel at within the national park. Lake Manyaraâs famous tree-Climbing lions are another reason to pay this park a visit. The only kind of their species in the world, they make the ancient mahogany and elegant acacias their home during the rainy season, and are a well-known but rather rare feature of the northern park. In addition to the lions, the national park is also home to the largest concentration of baboons anywhere in the world â a fact that makes for interesting game viewing of large families of the primates.

www.info-extranewsy24wp.com,1,en,3,92,"Contact Verification Suspension Page This domain has been suspended due to non-completion of an ICANN-mandated contact verification. As part of the ongoing effort to improve contact quality, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires validation for each registrant contact registering a generic TLD. This is required since January 1, 2014 for all gTLDs. If the domain registrantâs email address is not verified by the registrant, the domain must be suspended. Why has this domain been suspended? One of these reasons may apply: This is a new domain registration and the registrantâs email address has not been verified yet. This domain has been newly registered and the email address of the registrant has not been verified yet. The email address of the domain registrant has been modified or changed but not verified yet. Changing the email address of the domain registrant requires a verification. The domain has recently been transferred and the domain registrantâs email address has not yet been verified at the new registrar. ICANN registrars are required by policy to verify domain registrantâs email addresses, even after incoming transfers. Someone has complained about the accuracy of the data provided for publication in the WHOIS, triggering a re-verification of the email address of the domain registrant but the address has not been verified yet. Any reasonable complaint regarding whois accuracy triggers a requirement for the registrar to re-verify the email address. If you are the owner of this domain, you can reactivate it. Click the link provided in the verification email sent to you by your Registrar or direct service provider. After registering, transferring or modifying the registrant contact data of your domain, you should have received the verification email. Please click the included link and your domain will be unsuspended within 30 minutes. Please make sure to check your spam folder if you cannot find that mail. You can request to resend the verification email through your domain provider. The verification mail will be sent to the registrantâs email address used for this domain. If you are the registrant of this domain and unsure which email address is used, please log into your account at your domain provider to view or modify registrant contact data information. If you have the trigger code, enter it on http://emailverification.info/ The trigger code to verify your registrant contact data is contained in the verification mail. However, your domain provider might provide the respective trigger code under certain conditions. This trigger code can be entered on http://emailverification.info/ to verify your registrant contact data and remove the suspension on your domain. Frequently Asked Questions Why are domains with unverified registrant email addresses suspended? To ensure the contactability of the registrant, ICANN policies requires registrars to verify registrant email addresses and contact information within 15 days after registration and incoming transfers. If registrant data is not verified in time, ICANN mandates registrars to suspend the corresponding website of the affected domain. You can find information about the relevant ICANN Policy at: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/non-response-2014-01-29-en How can I prevent deactivation of my domain in the future? This requires the completion of the verification process within 15 days of the verification mail being sent to you. Make sure the email address you provide works and you mailbox is reviewed regularly. Make sure to expect a verification mail when making an update to your data. How can I reactivate my domain and remove the suspension? This requires the completion of the verification process. You can resend the verification mail through your domain provider. Also, if desired, you can update your registrant contact information at your domain provider and afterwards you will receive a verification email. How long does it take until my website comes back online after the suspension is removed? After the verification has been successfully completed the suspension is removed within 30 minutes. Please keep in mind that populating new DNS servers might take a bit longer due to DNS caching. Iâm not the owner of this domain. What can I do? If you are a visitor to this website, please try accessing this domain again later. Legal Notice"

Z toho plynú dlhodobé skúsenosti a prax v oblasti bazénov a bazénovej chémie. VIAC INFORMÁCIÍ Dodávame a inštalujeme Bazény, technológie a príslušenstvo k bazénom ponúkame v širokej škále typov a tvarov. U nás si vyberie každý, aj ten najnáročnejší zákazník. VIAC INFORMÁCIÍ Kalkulácia online Pre zjednodušenie celého procesu pri realizácii tej ktorej zákazky máme pre vás pripravený online formulár, ktorý vám i nám uľahčí počiatočnú komunikáciu. VIAC INFORMÁCIÍ BAZÉNY Fóliové bazény poskytnú pocit pohody a relaxu celej rodine. Bazén sa ľahko udržiava, inštalácia fólie je jednoduchá, nevyžaduje žiadne špeciálne úpravy alebo riešenia. Montované bazény sú konštrukčne vysoko kvalitným typom bazénov. Tento typ bazéna, vďaka jednoduchosti, ktorá je potrebná pre stavebnú pripravenosť, je optimálnym riešením pre exteriér. ČÍTAJ VIAC PREKRYTIE HLADINY Lamelové zakrytie bazénov je určené na chránenie obsahu bazénov proti vnikaniu rôznych nečistôt, pádu hlodavcov, žiab alebo hmyzu, úniku tepla (zníženie spotreby energie potrebnej na ohrev vody) a zabezpečenie predĺženej sezóny kúpania u vonkajších bazénov, zabraňuje odparovaniu vody a slúži na zvýšenie bezpečnosti detí a domácich zvierat (zabránenie pádu do otvorenej vody). ČÍTAJ VIAC ÚPRAVA VODY V prvom rade záleží od kvalitnej filtrácie a dôkladnom vysatí nečistôt z dna a stien bazénu. Zabudnúť nesmieme ani na chemickú údržbu za pomoci tzv. bazénovej chémie, ktorú treba robiť celú sezónu, inak by ste mohli mať namiesto čistej vody zelený močiar.

Lavorazioni Prima ancora che produttore di componenti meccanici, AFA è un partner capace , in grado di supportare il cliente in qualsiasi esigenza di progettazione con software 3D e stampaggio di componenti meccanici per motori. PROGETTAZIONE STAMPI Scopri STAMPAGGIO DI PRECISIONE Scopri TRATTAMENTI TERMICI Scopri La ditta Afa De Giorgi, presente sul mercato dal 1973, è nata come torneria per volontà dei fratelli Attilio e Gianfranco De Giorgi. Quello della produzione di componenti di minuteria meccanica di precisione per motori elettrici e la termoidraulica è oggi il settore di punta dell’azienda. Ben presto, fin dalla sua nascita, la ditta si è occupata della costruzione dei primi rudimentali stampi per effettuare lo stampaggio a freddo . Dopo un primo trasferimento nella sede di Paitone, nel 1989 l’azienda si spostò nella sede attuale, che si trova a Villanuova in provincia di Brescia. La struttura si è andata gradualmente ampliando, sempre grazie alle particolari abilità organizzative e tecniche dei fratelli De Giorgi: sono stati raggiunti i 4.000 metri quadrati coperti dell’attuale struttura, che è anche provvista di parcheggi sotterranei. Produzione di minuterie metalliche e componenti meccanici Afa De Giorgi è specializzata nella realizzazione e produzione di minuterie metalliche : componenti per termoidraulica e motori elettrici. I nostri clienti sono realtà nazionali ma anche internazionali: grandi aziende che si occupano nello specifico della produzione di motori per auto ed elettrodomestici ma anche di realtà che sono legate al settore della termoidraulica e a quello della meccanica di precisione. Siamo all’avanguardia nel settore della lavorazione di minuterie metalliche e l’azienda ricorre a lavorazioni meccaniche di precisione utilizzando materiali selezionati, come l’acciaio al carbonio, l’ottone, acciaio inox e bronzo fosforoso ma anche laminati e lamiere altoresistenziali per la realizzazione di minuteria metallica capace di rispondere efficacemente alle necessità tecniche ed estetiche dei nostri clienti. Le minuterie metalliche di precisione possono essere eseguite in azienda direttamente, ricorrendo a qualunque tipo di trattamento di finitura galvanica (stagnature, zincature) e possono essere fornite con burattature, filettature e oliature. Tutto questo grazie alla collaborazione in atto con aziende subfornitrici, altamente efficienti e di qualità oltre che legate da rapporti di fiducia. Lavorazioni Meccaniche di Precisione Conto Terzi Afa de Giorgi è specializzata anche in lavorazioni meccaniche di precisione conto terzi , servizio che consente alle aziende di affidarci la produzione di componenti critiche, beneficiando della nostra esperienza e delle nostre tecnologie avanzate. Ogni macchinario e impianto di trattamento termico è progettato per assicurare la conformità dal punto di vista dimensionale direttamente in linea di produzione. Questo consente di evitare di produrre minuteria meccanica e materiali non conformi: l’intero procedimento creativo viene seguito dal principio e fino alla piena realizzazione del prodotto, sempre nel nome di alti standard di sicurezza e affidabilità. Come azienda di lavorazioni meccaniche di precisione, Afa De Giorgi si distingue per l’impegno costante nella ricerca e nello sviluppo di soluzioni innovative, puntando a mantenere uno standard tecnologico elevatissimo. Il nostro obiettivo è rimanere sempre un passo avanti, anticipando le esigenze del mercato e offrendo ai nostri clienti prodotti e servizi che rappresentino il miglior standard disponibile nel settore delle lavorazioni meccaniche di precisione e della produzione di particolari meccanici.

RX Apes ""The most fun and addictive minting experience I've ever had."" - Every RX Ape minter, 2022 Customise Your RX Apes* *RX Apes are no longer available to mint. They are only available on secondary marketplaces. RX Apes is the first Project Rxnegade NFT collection. RX Ape images generate on demand, in real-time, and can be re-generated or ""Yeeted"" at least once per day if the token owner does not like the image that is generated. The skin tone and background colour of RX Apes can also be customised by the owner until the ape is 10/10 ""Yoinkable"", at which point the owner can give their ape a name, Yoink it, and lock-in the image and metadata which will then be revealed to the public. Rxnegades The Rxnegades (RXNGD) token is a membership token used to access the Rxnegade ecosystem and also to determine the destination for Rxnegade Royalties. Holding at least one membership token is required (except in special circumstances) to mint Rxnegade collection NFTs. Join Rxnegades Rxnegade Royalties You are the Creator! Every RXAPE token (and other collection tokens in the future) that is minted is forever linked to the Rxnegade member ID that minted it. The Rxnegade Apes contract uses this along with the NFT Royalty Standard to tell marketplaces (that support the standard) to send royalties from secondary sales of every RX Ape, directly to the wallet that holds the membership token linked to it. This unique and dynamic royalty implementation ultimately incentivises members to create their own utility and demand for the specific RX Apes that they mint."

Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Issue Over facebook and google in india Recently As we all know, that the supreme court of India has asked many social networking sites to remove all content which are Unexpectable by our Indian society.. many people are making fun of our social leaders,cricketers, politicians, social workers and many people this is not good in good sense. ofcourse it can be good for some peoples to take revenge and also to make fun.anyway our court has raised good point, i really appreciate our supreme court. Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Have a look at screenshots below for step by step guide. That’s it! This is the New Year gift from the Facebook to the Indian users. Note:-This service is currently available on Airtel, Aircel and Tata Docomo (India) & XLcom, Telkomsel (Indonesia). Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Simple 4 things to be secure your facebook account in 2012 In the last year December 7th the facebook founder Mark zuckerberg private photos were leaked to other photo sharing site later facebook identfied that the flaw was by a recent code change and the flaw lived only short limted time. its afecter many users including zukenberg ""Hackers are using more sophisticated methords and spammers sre for emails. Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3. Consider to Log Out from your account when you are leaving. If you are decided to go for an outing then dont forget to log out from facebook it will prevent from "" like jacking "" and many other such threats. Likejacking is a form of clickjacking or malicios methors that will lead to users like a website article or a website link as a status update without the intension of the user to ""like"" the thing.

SmartLinks are a suite of products integrated as one which helps you change the plain vanilla URL shorteners to do much more than just shorten your long URLs. They make your links, look better, read better, be on brand/topic, present better with relevant images, track and remarket, link downloadable files, trigger Call to Action banners on third party links and much more. What is a Social Card? A Social card allows you to choose an image, title, and description of your choice that will be displayed on social media platforms when you share your content across your social media. It gives you the power to post images as clickable links across channels instead of posting images and links separately. They impact the way your links are presented.

mioarttherapy.com,1,en,2,89,"Welcome to Mio's Art Therapy, Mountain View, CA ENGLISH | JAPANESE Top About Mio Column Counseling Art Therapy Marriage Family Therapy Anger Management Trauma Treatment About Clinic Contact us There are so many people affected by the earthquake in Japan. My heart goes to them and I sincerely hope they get enough support and rest. I would like to provide a FREE relaxation session (not therapy/one time only) for people who are affected by this disaster. Please contact me for more info. Thank you. Welcome to Mio's Art Therapy Most of us, if not all of us, come to a point in life where we need to regain our balance and redefine our goals. I know this because I have seen my clients, friends, and myself in such situations. By working together with you, I can help you focus, mobilize your inner strength and establish new strategies to overcome problems that have become apparent. Topics that I handle include grief and trauma coping, relationship or family issues, anger management, and cultural or generational conflicts. Our mutual goal will be to define the issue, adjust, become effective again and re-discover satisfaction in life. Based on my extensive work experience I feel comfortable working with adults or with children using conservative talking therapy as well as more creative approaches such as art or play therapy. I also offer newer approaches such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), a form of therapy developed to help the individual cope with disturbing and unresolved life experiences and traumas. Please do not hesitate to contact me for if you have anyquestions. I hope to work with you or your loved one to regain balance and take control. Mio Yamashita, M.A., ATR, MFT Individual, Child, Senior, Family Therapy, Acculturation, Art Therapy, Anger Management, EMDR, MFC 45670 851 Fremont Avenue, Suite 102, Los Altos, CA 94024 408-605-6258 All Rights Reserved ©Mio Yamashita 2009"

E’ un’azienda che fa capo alla famiglia Crespo che è composta da Giorgio, Luisella, Stefania, Riccardo e comprende vivai di produzione e garden center. Fin da subito la mission dell’azienda è stata trasmettere… La Nostra Storia Sostenibilità Negli ultimi anni, la sensibilità verso le tematiche ambientali è cresciuta notevolmente, trasformandosi in un requisito fondamentale per adottare nuovi modelli di sviluppo più sostenibili e responsabili. Consapevoli di questa necessità, ci impegniamo attivamente per contribuire al cambiamento e fare la nostra parte.  Il Nostro Impegno per il Pianeta Prenderci cura del nostro Pianeta significa garantirci un futuro migliore, perché un ambiente sano e protetto restituisce benessere a tutti noi. È per questo che sosteniamo con orgoglio le iniziative di Greenpeace, condividendo i loro valori e il loro impegno per la salvaguardia della Terra.  Energia Pulita per un Futuro Sostenibile Dal 2013 il nostro impianto fotovoltaico da 48 kWp è in funzione, consentendoci di ridurre significativamente il nostro impatto ambientale. Ogni anno, grazie a questa scelta sostenibile, evitiamo l’emissione di 34.925 kg di CO₂, contribuendo attivamente alla lotta contro il cambiamento climatico.  Un Giardino Naturale e Responsabile Nel nostro garden privilegiamo l’uso di concimi e rimedi naturali per prenderci cura delle piante in modo sostenibile. L’impiego di prodotti chimici è limitato ai soli casi in cui non esistano alternative, garantendo così un equilibrio tra efficacia e rispetto per l’ambiente.

НАШИ ОФИСЫ Москва Перейти Владимир Перейти Волгоград Перейти Тольятти Перейти Ростов-на-Дону Перейти Оренбург Перейти Казань Перейти ОТЗЫВЫ СОТРУДНИКОВ Мы знаем, что более счастливые и довольные сотрудники работают лучше Специалист по работе с клиентами Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Созданы все условия для работы, спокойствие, нет конфликтных клиентов, ДМС, график работы, достойная зарплата, начальники всегда идут на уступки. Все для людей, как говорится. Мне очень нравится. Что можно было бы улучшить: Можно бы и премию увеличить, а так много плюсов в нашей компании. Специалист поддержки (удаленно) Отзыв с teleperformancerabota.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Очень нравится работа в данном месте, обучение на оператора шло неделю и за это время мы старались изучить как можно больше информации. Думаю это получилось сделать, тренер ""Николай"" нам попался очень хороший 👍. После прохождения клк мы попали в группу к супервайзеру ""Кристина Ли"" она очень лояльна к нам и старается ответить на все поставленные вопросы и если ответа не знает, обязательно записывает и приходит с обратной связью. Сам проект мне так же нравится. Тут уже каждый сам решает — нравится ли им данная работа. Мне очень нравится. Хочу сказать огромное спасибо сотруднику по подбору персонала за то, что нашла моё резюме и позвала на работу в такую компанию как эта, к сожалению, имя сотрудника я не помню. В общем, хотелось просто сказать спасибо всему коллективу за такой тёплый приём, хочу проработать как можно дольше в tp и узнать много нового🥰 Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Дружный и сплоченый коллектив. Возможность карьерного роста и развития в сфере деятельности. Радует наличие полиса ДМС(доп мед страхования) благодаря которому открывает многообразный спектр выбора и посещения специалистов в различных платных и бесплатных поликлиник и больниц. Стабильные и своевременные выплаты. Работа по схеме полностью белой заработной платы. Есть премиальные. А также различные поощрения всего коллектива за успехи в работе, в виде совместных посещений различных заведений развлекательного характера. Работой в организации доволен. Не сказать что работаешь""как папа карло"",но и не сидишь сложа руки. Что можно было бы улучшить: Хотелось бы увеличть количество шкавчиков в раздевалках. Бывает их не хватает. И немного увеличить их объем. А все остальное отлично. Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Очень лояльное руководство. Всегда идут навстречу. Думаю, лучший КЦ в городе из всех представленных. Что можно было бы улучшить: Уровень заработной платы на момент моей работы был маловат, но всё же больше, чем в другом КЦ. Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: В целом отличное место для работы, особенно для начинающих. Коллектив встретил очень хорошо, хоть я если честно по началу не особо работать хотел. А так всему обучили, зп платят во время. Что можно было бы улучшить: Я проработал пока пол года и если честно, есть пару претензий, вообще не следят за тем, что люди курят в туалете айкос, не очень приятно. И в столовой надо как по мне чуть чаще завозить продукты, ибо после обеда если туда идти, останешься голодным. Специалист по обучению и развитию персонала Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Работаю уже много лет за все время не было ни одной задержки зарплаты. Есть удобная зона отдыха с гамаком и теннисным столом, можно с пользой провести перерыв. Что можно было бы улучшить: Очень хотелось бы, чтобы поставили кулеры в тренерских или рядом с ними, возле выхода из помещений, чтобы не бегать на кухню. Специалист call-центра Отзыв с otrude.xyz Плюсы: Хорошая ЗП, оплата всегда вовремя, приятный коллектив и много возможностей карьерного роста. Хороший буфет и удобная зона отдыха в перерывах.

Волгоград Плюсы: Комфортабельный офис в центре города, дружный коллектив, лояльное начальство, удобный график работы, своевременная выплата зарплаты, различные конкурсы и мероприятия, чтобы сотрудникам хотелось приходить на работу и работать. Например, за хорошие показатели в работе, мою группу не раз поощряли походом в кафе. Что можно улучшить: Я работаю в компании уже 1,5 года и меня все устраивает. Менять что-либо в ближайшем будущем не собираюсь. Специалист по работе с клиентами Отзыв с dreamjob.ru г. Москва Что мне нравится в работодателе: Оформление официальное, зарплата без задержек. Обучение и тренинги как в начале работы, так и на протяжении всего времени. Прекрасное расположение офиса. Что можно было бы улучшить: Вернуть йогу в офис, очень нравилось. Добавить больше мероприятий. Специалист по работе с клиентами Отзыв с dreamjob.ru г. Ростов-на-Дону Что мне нравится в работодателе: Всегда учитывают мои пожелания и идут на встречу в каких то ситуациях, очень внимательны к сотрудникам Что можно было бы улучшить: Все нравится, но можно было шкафчики для одежды по шире сделать летом они норм для сумки и личных вещей, а зимой куртка не влазит Специалист по работе с клиентами Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Созданы все условия для работы, спокойствие, нет конфликтных клиентов, ДМС, график работы, достойная зарплата, начальники всегда идут на уступки. Все для людей, как говорится. Мне очень нравится. Что можно было бы улучшить: Можно бы и премию увеличить, а так много плюсов в нашей компании. Специалист поддержки (удаленно) Отзыв с teleperformancerabota.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Очень нравится работа в данном месте, обучение на оператора шло неделю и за это время мы старались изучить как можно больше информации. Думаю это получилось сделать, тренер ""Николай"" нам попался очень хороший 👍. После прохождения клк мы попали в группу к супервайзеру ""Кристина Ли"" она очень лояльна к нам и старается ответить на все поставленные вопросы и если ответа не знает, обязательно записывает и приходит с обратной связью. Сам проект мне так же нравится. Тут уже каждый сам решает — нравится ли им данная работа. Мне очень нравится. Хочу сказать огромное спасибо сотруднику по подбору персонала за то, что нашла моё резюме и позвала на работу в такую компанию как эта, к сожалению, имя сотрудника я не помню. В общем, хотелось просто сказать спасибо всему коллективу за такой тёплый приём, хочу проработать как можно дольше в tp и узнать много нового🥰 Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Дружный и сплоченый коллектив. Возможность карьерного роста и развития в сфере деятельности. Радует наличие полиса ДМС(доп мед страхования) благодаря которому открывает многообразный спектр выбора и посещения специалистов в различных платных и бесплатных поликлиник и больниц. Стабильные и своевременные выплаты. Работа по схеме полностью белой заработной платы. Есть премиальные. А также различные поощрения всего коллектива за успехи в работе, в виде совместных посещений различных заведений развлекательного характера. Работой в организации доволен. Не сказать что работаешь""как папа карло"",но и не сидишь сложа руки. Что можно было бы улучшить: Хотелось бы увеличть количество шкавчиков в раздевалках. Бывает их не хватает. И немного увеличить их объем. А все остальное отлично. Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Очень лояльное руководство. Всегда идут навстречу. Думаю, лучший КЦ в городе из всех представленных. Что можно было бы улучшить: Уровень заработной платы на момент моей работы был маловат, но всё же больше, чем в другом КЦ. Специалист поддержки Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: В целом отличное место для работы, особенно для начинающих. Коллектив встретил очень хорошо, хоть я если честно по началу не особо работать хотел. А так всему обучили, зп платят во время. Что можно было бы улучшить: Я проработал пока пол года и если честно, есть пару претензий, вообще не следят за тем, что люди курят в туалете айкос, не очень приятно. И в столовой надо как по мне чуть чаще завозить продукты, ибо после обеда если туда идти, останешься голодным. Специалист по обучению и развитию персонала Отзыв с dreamjob.ru Что мне нравится в работодателе: Работаю уже много лет за все время не было ни одной задержки зарплаты. Есть удобная зона отдыха с гамаком и теннисным столом, можно с пользой провести перерыв. Что можно было бы улучшить: Очень хотелось бы, чтобы поставили кулеры в тренерских или рядом с ними, возле выхода из помещений, чтобы не бегать на кухню.

www.teccna.de,1,de,3,329,"Über ABOUT KONTAKT IMPRESSUM DATENSCHUTZ KONTAKT TECCNA ist eine facettenreiche Künstlerin, deren musikalische Reise von ihren ersten Bühnenauftritten in der Grundschule bis zur Präsenz in der Berliner Musikszene reicht. Ihre Leidenschaft für die Musik und das Theater, gepaart mit dem Drang, kreative Ausdrücke zu erkunden, führte sie zu bedeutenden Rollen in renommierten Theaterprojekten. Als Kind von Spätaussiedlern in Deutschland erlebte TECCNA Ausgrenzung, fand jedoch in der Musik eine Zuflucht und ein Mittel zur Selbstbehauptung. Inspiriert von Ikonen wie Hannah Montana, beschloss sie mit 15 Jahren, ihr Leben der Musik zu widmen. Trotz anfänglicher Herausforderungen bahnte sie sich ihren Weg in die Musikindustrie, was in einer wegweisenden Songwriting-Session in London gipfelte. TECCNA verfolgt das Ziel, durch ihre Musik eine Bewegung zu schaffen, die die Grenzen der Musik und Gesellschaft überwindet. Sie steht für Diversität, Feminismus und Body Positivity in der Popkultur und vereint verschiedene musikalische Einflüsse mit futuristischen Elementen. Ihre Vision ist es, inklusive Räume zu schaffen, die Gemeinschaft und Freiheit fördern. TECCNA will mehr als nur eine Musikerin sein, sie ist eine Visionärin, die einlädt, durch ihre Kunst einen Pfad der Selbstentdeckung und kollektiven Ermächtigung zu beschreiten.

We may notify you of significant changes to this policy. Your rights In this Section 5, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. Your principal rights under data protection law are: the right to access; the right to rectification; the right to erasure; the right to restrict processing; the right to object to processing; the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and the right to withdraw consent. You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is: consent; or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.

Coinbase CEO admits hundreds of customer accounts were hacked Coinbase CEO Kris Marszalek said around 400 customer accounts have been compromised in a hack in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. His confirmation of the breach comes after multiple Coinbase users alleged their funds had been stolen — complaints that had until now been met with vague responses from the company. While Marszalek did not provide details as to how the hack occurred, he told Bloomberg TV that the exchange was back online “about 13-14 hours” after the incident and that all the impacted accounts were reimbursed. Marszalek’s statement marks the first official acknowledgment by Coinbase that a hack did, in fact, occur. Coinbase first paused withdrawals on its platform on Sunday after noting via Twitter that a “small number of users [are] reporting suspicious activity on their accounts.” It also asked customers to reset their two-factor authentication out of “an abundance of caution.” The company then reassured users numerous times in its communications that customer funds were safe, drawing speculation that Coinbase would cover any customer losses incurred. The losses may amount to $15 million worth of ETH, blockchain security provider PeckShield tweeted on Monday. PeckShield claimed in the tweet that about half of the funds were being sent to Tornado Cash to be “washed.” Tornado Cash says it provides “non-custodial anonymous transactions” on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning it can hide where crypto is being sent.​ ​ Personal Loan Advice Proin eget cursus dui.

The initial discourse revolved around the ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market amidst the escalating crisis in Ukraine, elucidating the incumbent risks tied to investing in such volatile times. However, the atmosphere brimmed with anticipation when Huang unveiled a new horizon for investors - the Quantum Ai cryptocurrency platform, a joint development of Nvidia. The Quantum Ai platform wasn’t revealed in a vacuum, it came at a time when the market was in dire need of a groundbreaking solution. Initially, the focus was primarily on the US market, but with the spotlight on it during the Fox News segment, the global arena is now set to be a part of this revolutionary trading platform, marking a significant milestone in the narrative of cryptocurrency trading and investment. In Dialogue with Maria Bartiromo: Quantum Ai 's Anticipated Unveiling by Jensen Huang Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo was eager to delve into the details when Jensen Huang graced the set with his presence. The spotlight was on the recently launched Quantum Ai platform, which is set to merge the realms of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency trading. Maria, with her knack for meticulous inquiry, posed the question many had on their minds, ""Why the wait on the announcement, and what was the genesis of the trading algorithm that powers Quantum Ai ?"" Jensen, with a blend of enthusiasm and conviction, responded, “My fascination with cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence is long-standing. Recognizing the volatility yet the immense potential in the cryptocurrency market, it was imperative to devise a mechanism that not only navigates through the market intricacies but also makes trading a profitable venture. The idea was to bring to fruition a platform where even the novice trader could invest with a degree of confidence. "" As the discussion progressed, the financial wizardry of Quantum Ai was put to the test live on Fox Business. Jensen, with a touch on his phone, unveiled to the audience the earnings potential of the platform. He showcased an account that started with a humble $250 investment, which saw a remarkable growth to $665 in just a day's trading activity. The screen flashed the figures, and Maria, evidently taken aback by the impressive earnings, further probed on the user earnings. She requested a glimpse into another user’s earnings, to which Jensen showcased a user from the UK who had started with a similar $250 investment back in October. The figures were astonishing ($967), validating the efficacy of Quantum Ai ’s trading algorithm. Jensen wanted to continue the interview, but he was rudely interrupted (most likely the National Banks intervened here). We decided to interview Jensen outside of Fox Business. EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH JENSEN HUANG ON CBS MORNINGS On a crisp morning, CBS Mornings studio buzzed with anticipation as Jensen Huang made his entrance for an exclusive interview with Gayle King. The focus was on the newly launched Quantum Ai platform, a merger of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency trading that promises a redefined trading experience. Gayle King: ""Jensen, the launch of Quantum Ai on Fox News created quite the stir. Could you delve into what spurred the creation of this platform?"" Jensen Huang: “The inception of Quantum Ai is rooted in the recognition of the boundless potential within the cryptocurrency market, despite its known volatility. We envisioned a platform that navigates through this volatility, ensuring a profitable venture for investors. It's about harnessing artificial intelligence to unlock a new realm of trading possibilities.” Gayle King: ""There's a promise of guaranteed profits with Quantum Ai . How does the platform ensure this?"" Jensen Huang: “ Quantum Ai operates on a meticulously crafted algorithm that analyzes market trends in real time, ensuring informed trading decisions. Our initial trials have shown a significant profit margin even with a minimal investment of $250, which soared to $670 within a day. It’s about making cryptocurrency trading accessible, profitable, and less daunting for everyone.” Gayle King: ""You emphasized the importance of cryptocurrency as a lucrative investment avenue. Could you elaborate on that?"" Jensen Huang: “Certainly, despite the oscillations, cryptocurrencies remain a modern-day gold rush. There’s a plethora of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Litecoin, which have shown tremendous profit margins. Quantum Ai is designed to tap into this potential, offering a platform where profits are not merely a possibility, but a reality.” Gayle King: ""How does Quantum Ai stand out in ensuring profits even for individuals new to cryptocurrency trading?"" Jensen Huang: “The essence of Quantum Ai is to democratize cryptocurrency trading. Our platform is designed to be intuitive, guiding individuals through the trading process, backed by a robust AI-driven algorithm that optimizes trading strategies for maximum profitability. It’s about opening the doors to financial prosperity in a market that holds immense potential.” Gayle King: ""Sounds incredible. This is what everyone needs during these difficult times."" Jensen Huang: ""We are navigating through challenging economic waters, and Quantum Ai emerges as a beacon of hope for many. However, the path is laden with fear and misinformation, often propagated by large financial institutions, wary of the dent in their earnings as individuals gain the capability to earn substantial amounts independently. Cryptocurrency isn't just a fleeting trend; it's a financial revolution that's reshaping how we perceive and handle money. Ignoring this wave of change might result in missed opportunities for many. And that’s why we are already testing the platform and receiving a lot of positive feedback. Among the myriad of appreciative messages, one that stands out is from a single mother. She shared how the earnings from Quantum Ai enabled her to provide a comfortable home and a promising future for her son. The pictures of her son's first day at a well-reputed college, funded by earnings from Quantum Ai , was heartwarming. It wasn’t just a testimony to Quantum Ai ’s potential but a glimpse into the profound impact it could have on individuals' lives. This platform is more than just a trading arena; it's a vessel of hope, empowering individuals to improve their lives significantly. Gayle King: ""The registration process on Quantum Ai , is it cumbersome? What's required from prospective investors?"" Jensen Huang: “We have streamlined the registration to be swift and secure. It requires basic information like name, email, and phone number for identity verification. Once registered, a personal manager assists in setting up the account, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. It’s structured to get investors on the trading floor with ease and confidence.” Gayle King: ""Lastly, what message would you like to share with our readers?"" Jensen Huang: ""Growing up, the financial landscape was quite rigid. Opportunities to amass wealth were often tied to traditional jobs. Fast forward to now, the digital age, especially with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, has broadened the horizon immensely. Quantum Ai is our way of navigating this new gold rush of the 21st century, making it accessible to everyone. I encourage everyone not to miss out on this chance to elevate their financial standing. However, the slots on the platform are limited, and once they're filled, it might be a while before more open up. So, act swiftly!” Post-interview, our editorial team assigned three members to test the Quantum Ai platform, with each injecting a starting capital of $250. The results a week later were astonishing with a tenfold increase in profits. The earnings were seamlessly transferred to our team members' personal accounts without a hitch. We understand the curiosity and the eagerness among our readers to explore Quantum Ai . To aid in this endeavor, one of our team members who tested the platform has crafted a comprehensive guide titled ""Navigating Quantum Ai : A Starter's Handbook”, to help you get started on this promising journey.

All that I had saved for safety (after all, the crisis) - I decided to put into action! Overnight they turned into 18,000 🔥🔥🔥🔥. Reply 45 4 Share Amanda Ferris 10 hrs ago I will tell you my story. I registered on this platform, they called me and told me everything. There was no money for the deposit, I decided to take a risk and borrowed from a friend $335. Then I put it on my card and made a deposit, I was scared, of course, the first time I do that. Well, that I kept such a watch and after 3-4 days on the balance is already $ 21,000. Half immediately withdrew to the card, paid debt of 335 and put away 10,000. The rest of the money in the work. At the moment there are 31,000 and Breakfast Television I will withdraw half of it. Reply 65 6 Share Eric Little 8 hrs ago Nice!!! I registered and will try it! I knew about it for a long time, but I still had no 352$ to invest!

"" Derek AuCoin Business Manager, Port Harcourt FAQ Of Customer If you have any questions ? please ask us and we will answer you as quickly as possible How much does it cost to service a generator? Generally, most generators will require at least one FULL service per year. We call this a Major Service to inspect the machine and perform a complete fluid and filter replacement. But many residential customers and most commercial property owners opt for a semi-annual service contract to include a Major Service and a Minor Inspection. All these factors play a role in determining the actual labor time and materials needed to work on your generator. For a price that meets your exact needs, please contact us with as much information as possible. Do you service Portable Generators? Yes, we do! We can service them at your location too. But to save money, most prefer to bring them to our shop. Generally, our turn-around time is about ten to twenty days, but that is subject to parts availability. Do you install generators? In short, yes! Adfoldam Generator Services can provide a quote for your entire generator purchase and installation project. We offer Generac and Gillette generator packages for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Allow us to size the right Emergency Power System for your needs. Do you offer service contracts? We offer customized generator maintenance and service contracts structured around your unique requirements. The benefits of having a service contract with us ensures the fastest 24/7 response during a power emergency. It also saves you money by contracting at a lower rate than those without a service agreement. No matter the brand, our Service technicians are versed in all generator packages and systems. How can I stay informed about generator maintenance? We’re so glad you asked. With frequent changes to generator regulations and recommended service requirements, staying legal and keeping your generator prepared for the next power outage is complicated.

En savoir plus L'EXPERTISE DE VISTORY RÉCOMPENSÉE L'innovation de rupture au service de la maintenance Notre système d’exploitation MainChain a été récompensé dans plusieurs concours pour sa contribution technologique au développement de l’industrie distribuée et pour l’innovation qu’il apporte à la gestion sécurisée de la chaîne d’approvisionnement de la fabrication additive et de la propriété intellectuelle. 2023 Grand Prix de l’électronique Général Ferrié Depuis 1963, le Grand Prix de l’Électronique « Général Ferrié » est décerné annuellement. Il récompense un ingénieur ou scientifique dont les travaux ont contribué d’une manière importante, aux progrès des Systèmes d’Information et de Communication, y compris dans leurs aspects énergétiques. 2022 Créateur d'avenir Concours coorganisé par le Berry Républicain, la CCI du Cher et Bourges Plus, Vistory a été lauréat de la catégorie « Entreprise innovante ». 2022 Techinnov Le concours Techinnov, organisé par la CCI Essonne et la CCI Paris Île-de-France, et sponsorisé par Airbus et MBDA, met en lumière les toutes dernières innovations pouvant répondre aux besoins technologiques d’Airbus Defence & Space et de MBDA, l’objectif étant d’identifier des pistes de collaboration. 2021 Jayat Le concours de l’innovation du MCO-T (Maintien en Conditions Opérationnelles – Terrestre) organisé par la SIMMT (Structure intégrée du maintien en condition opérationnelle des matériels terrestres). 2021 Defstart Programme d’accompagnement des start-ups évoluant ou souhaitant se développer dans les domaines défense et sécurité organisé par le Centre Information de la Défense de l’agglomération Bourges Plus. DES RÉPONSES AUX ENJEUX ACTUELS Des enjeux de société et de souveraineté Les enjeux actuels de la société sont nombreux et complexes. La souveraineté industrielle est devenue un sujet de préoccupation pour de nombreux pays qui ont vu l’ampleur de leur dépendance pendant la crise covid et maintenant la guerre en Ukraine. À cela s’ajoute la question cruciale du développement durable et la nécessité de trouver un équilibre entre croissance économique et protection de l’environnement. Produire au plus près du besoin et le juste nécessaire sont donc deux axes essentiels. Lutte contre l'obsolescence L'indisponibilité de pièces de rechange peut entraîner des arrêts et retards de production ou d'exploitation, mettant à mal la rentabilité et la relation client.​ La solution Résilience industrielle La crise du Covid et la guerre en Ukraine ont mis en évidence nos carences industrielles. L’approvisionnement de pièces détachées ou de matériaux de construction sont mis à mal, notre économie ralentit, nos meilleurs ennemis ont le contrôle. La solution Lutte contre le réchauffement climatique La production de masse délocalisée induit des transports énergétivores (et coûteux) pour des produits qui ne seront peut-être jamais utilisés. Sans compter l’artificialisation des sols pour entreposer les stocks reçus. La solution Optimisation de l'exploitation des ressources Produire loin est synonyme de produire beaucoup pour rentabiliser des coûts de transport qui explosent et s’adapter aux process conventionnels de production. Des pièces vouées en partie à dormir dans des stocks coûteux. La solution Réduction des déchets La planète croule sous les déchets, le recyclage reste coûteux et énergétivore. Tandis que la destruction de stocks dormants et l’obsolescence programmée alourdissent encore la facture environnementale. La solution Diminution des coûts et contraintes de stockage La production de masse nécessite des surfaces de stockage et les infrastructures associées pour la logistique et la manutention, autant de coûts venant réduire la valeur du stock entreposé. La solution NOS PRODUITS ET NOS RÉPONSES Vistory répond aux enjeux industriels d'aujourd'hui et de demain Un accompagnement sur mesure de votre transformation industrielle MainChain Organiser une chaîne de production distribuée sécurisée pour produire au plus près du besoin.

En savoir plus Notre système d'exploitation sécurisé : MainChain La production distribuée est associée à des risques juridiques et commerciaux. La maîtrise de l’intégrité des données et la traçabilité de l’ensemble des opérations sont essentielles pour garantir le respect des contrats et la qualité de la production, et créer ainsi une relation de confiance. Traçabilité et certification des données et des opérations NOS GARANTIES Protection contre la contrefaçon Maîtriser le respect des contrats et de la propriété industrielle est une priorité mais les fichiers numériques sont très volatiles.

Chaque événement est identifié, tracé, pour efficacement en trouver la source. Certification de la production Pour chaque design utilisé, MainChain certifie que le process de fabrication et les réglages machines sont bien ceux définis par le concepteur d'origine, garantissant ainsi la qualité de production.

Fr. James P. Kunnath MBA (HHCM) Executive Director St. Thomas Institutions of Healthcare and Medical Education (STIHAME) Executive Director's Message Dear Friends, The demand for healthcare is never ending, so also the demand for healthcare professionals. By the grace of God, humanity has developed technology that can give accuracy, speed and quality to the practice of medicine. Thanks to the work done by training centres across the world; we are running short of paramedical professionals. On the other hand, there are also institutions who came up to exploit the situation with deceit. As a hospital with 67 years of history, we are into the training of paramedical professionals, both technical and administrative. This is a humble attempt to avail quality healthcare workers. For the local youth, of course, this will open career avenues. We have a track record of excellence and the award given for the best centre in South India by the University for the past two years consecutively. Our former students, presently placed in esteemed institutions are our matter of pride. Let us work together in the formation of quality healthcare professionals and thereby serve life and humanity. May God bless you all Rev. Fr. Jacob Athikalam Asso. Director, Academics & Clinics Asso.

El seguro no aplica para pérdidas parciales, daños parciales, inmovilizaciones parciales o totales, cambios de modalidad por parte de la aduana o cualquier retención de mercancía por parte de la autoridad aduanera de cada país, por tanto no serán procedentes reclamaciones en este sentido. El empaque y embalaje de la mercancía es responsabilidad del cliente. Reiteramos nuestro compromiso por entregar el mejor servicio y la mayor seguridad. COD (Cash On Delivery Service) Este servicio aplica exclusivamente para Colombia y es opcional para las agencias que deseen utilizarlo, por tanto no están obligadas a ofrecerlo. La guía sólo será consolidada y enviada una vez se valide el pago total de la mercancía de acuerdo al cobro automático que arroja el sistema, de lo contrario permanecerá en el centro logístico de Miami. Transcurridos 30 días si la mercancía no ha sido pagada procederemos a declararla en abandono. Una vez es declarada en abandono la agencia podrá solicitar la devolución en los siguientes 4 días hábiles y el costo del retorno será asumido exclusivamente por la agencia. TARIFA DÓLAR Imperio Cargo Express Corp. se reserva el derecho de fijar una TRM del dólar de acuerdo a las condiciones del mercado. Esta tarifa es aplicable únicamente para pagos COD o para los servicios de casillero de las empresas afiliadas. TV`S Y MERCANCÍA DELICADA Televisores y mercancía cuya naturaleza sea de manejo delicado serán transportadas una vez el cliente haya firmado de manera libre y autónoma el consentimiento informado de Imperio Cargo Express Corp. sobre el transporte de mercancía delicada donde se deja claro que Imperio Cargo Express Corp. no se hace responsable frente a daños parciales o totales de dicha mercancía. El seguro no aplica y el cliente renuncia de manera voluntaria a cualquier reclamación por afectaciones a la mercancía. CELULARES Por disposición de la aduana colombiana todo celular sin excepción debe ser ingresado en una guía única con el respectivo número IMEI y partida arancelaria. Cualquier celular que no cumpla con estos requisitos podrá ser sujeto de cambio de modalidad. CARGA SOBREDIMENSIONADA Mercancía u objetos que sean sobredimensionados como un colchón, tabla de surf, muebles de sala, carros eléctricos para niños, etc. Deberá ser reportada por la agencia a Imperio Cargo Express Corp. para la cotización del flete correspondiente por sobredimensión. MERCANCÍA EN ABANDONO Se considera mercancía en abandono todo envío que se encuentre almacenado en cualquiera de los centros logísticos de Imperio Cargo Express Corp que no hubiese sido pagado en los siguientes 30 días de creación de la guía. Del mismo modo se considera en abandono toda mercancía que el cliente comunica de manera verbal o escrita que no desea o puede pagar. Para guías retenidas por pago en cualquiera de los centros logísticos el tiempo límite será de 30 días una vez la guía se encuentra almacenada. Para reclamar en oficinas de Envía, Servientrega, TCC o cualquier operador será al tercer día hábil. RETIRO DE MERCANCÍA EN OFICINA OPERADOR Toda mercancía enviada para ser reclamada en oficina del Operador debe ser reclamada por tardar al tercer día hábil de encontrarse en la oficina, de lo contrario la guía será declarada en abandono a menos que el destinatario y la agencia se comprometan por escrito a pagar los días de bodegaje que diera a lugar. Si el destinatario no hace el pago del bodegaje, la deuda será cargada a la agencia. RETIRO DE MERCANCÍA EN OFICINA BOGOTÁ Toda mercancía enviada para ser reclamada en el centro logístico de Imperio Cargo Express Corp. en Bogotá D.C. podrá ser retirada por el destinatario que aparece en la guía internacional presentando documento de identidad. La guía podrá ser retirada por otra persona previa autorización escrita por parte de la agencia donde se especifique nombre y documento de identidad de la persona que retira. Este proceso deberá hacerse dentro de los horarios de atención de Imperio Cargo Express Corp Colombia y deberá informarse un día antes del retiro de la mercancía para prepararla. Cualquier guía que no sea reclamada en los siguientes 30 días hábiles de encontrarse almacenada será considerada mercancía en abandono sin posibilidad de reclamación. REAJUSTES DIAN La Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales de Colombia, DIAN, tiene el deber y la autoridad para revisar físicamente cualquier paquete que ingresa a territorio colombiano. Así mismo, si la DIAN considera que la mercancía tiene un valor superior al declarado por el cliente y/o la agencia, podrá realizar un reajuste del impuesto de manera discrecional. Esta diferencia deberá ser cancelada por el cliente en las siguientes 72 horas de reportado, de lo contrario la guía quedará a disposición de la DIAN e Imperio Cargo Express Corp no tendrá ninguna intermediación ni responsabilidad frente a la misma. Durante las primeras 72 horas de reportado el reajuste el cliente tendrá derecho a presentar apelación si no está de acuerdo con el reajuste presentando las facturas que den cuenta de la totalidad de la mercancía contenida en la guía, de lo contrario, la apelación no será procedente. Transcurridos 30 días la mercancía será declarada por la DIAN en abandono. CAMBIOS DE MODALIDAD La Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales de Colombia, DIAN, tiene autoridad y potestad para revisar físicamente cualquier envío. Así mismo, si la DIAN considera que la mercancía no cumple con los requisitos para ingresar mediante la modalidad de Tráfico Postal y Envíos Urgentes (Decreto 2685 de 1999) podrá realizar un Cambio de Modalidad de importación. En este caso la guía será enviada a un depósito aduanero autorizado y el destinatario de la misma tendrá el derecho a reclamar la documentación en las oficinas de Imperio Cargo Express Corp. en Bogotá D.C. para que realice el trámite de importación directamente con el depósito aduanero. En este caso Imperio Cargo Express Corp. no realizará ningún trámite de intermediación, ni gestión frente al depósito aduanero y este proceso deberá ser asumido exclusivamente por el destinatario de la guía o de la persona a quien otorgue poder. INMOVILIZACIONES Y RETENCIONES DE INVIMA E ICA En el proceso de nacionalización se podrán presentar inmovilizaciones y decomisos parciales o totales por parte de las diferentes entidades regulatorias de Colombia. Estos procesos son ajenos a Imperio Cargo Express Corp. y será el destinatario de la guía quien deba realizar los procedimientos correspondientes para la liberación de su mercancía según lo disponga la autoridad. COMPRAS CON TARJETA DE CRÉDITO IMPERIO CARGO EXPRESS CORP Es un servicio opcional de Imperio Cargo Express Corp. y sus empresas aliadas. Tiene un costo del 10% sobre el valor de la compra. No nos hacemos responsables del contenido de la mercancía una vez el cliente recibe el envío en su país de destino. Podrá solicitar antes del envío una revisión física de la mercancía para su tranquilidad. DEVOLUCIONES DE MERCANCÍA A ESTADOS UNIDOS No contamos con servicio de despacho de mercancía hacia Estados Unidos desde ningún país. Por tal motivo, si recibe un envío que desea regresar a Estados Unidos debe buscar una empresa distinta para tal fin y asumir los costos que ello implique. ¡Tu mensaje ha sido enviado!

Instalamos um dispositivo em um local estratégico do veículo, de modo que ele não apareça e seja de difícil acesso. Após a instalação, você poderá acessar as informações emitidas pelo equipamento, como endereço, ignição, velocidade e outras informações através do nosso aplicativo ou acesso web pelo computador. - Quanto tempo dura uma instalação? A instalação dura em torno de 40 minutos a 1 hora. - Tenho uma frota, qual retorno financeiro que o serviço pode me trazer? Redução de tempo de condução do veículo, diminuindo gastos com pneu, manutenção e outros; redução com custo de combustível; acesso rápido para verificar qual veículo está mais acessível ao seu cliente, trazendo mais agilidade, confiabilidade e qualidade no seu atendimento; redução de improdutividade dos funcionários; aumento da segurança dos seus veículos e de seus funcionários; redução de chances de colisão monitorando a velocidade que o funcionário conduz; aumento da durabilidade dos veículos; controle de viagem, com histórico; controle do numero de visitas comerciais; visualização dos locais onde seu colaborador percorreu com o veículo; visualização dos locais onde seu colaborador parou com o veículo; visualização de quanto tempo seu colaborador permaneceu em cada local; visualização caso o colaborador utilize o veículo da empresa para fins pessoais. - Tenho dúvidas, tenho algum suporte?

O rastreador para veículos foi criado para que os proprietários dos mais diversos automóveis e motocicletas pudessem ter total controle de onde seus bens estão e protegê-los de roubos, tanto os veículos como também as cargas e pessoas, os rastreadores se tornaram cada vez mais avançados e a tecnologia permite que os rastreadores funcionem mesmo em lugares distantes, como em sítios e cidades afastadas dos grandes centros, desde que haja sinal de celular. - vocês fazem busca e recuperação? Não, a busca e recuperação deve ser feita diretamente pela polícia informando os dados do veículo e a localização obtida pelo rastreamento. - A Cadê ressarce em caso de não localizar meu veículo? Nossa tecnologia funciona para reduzir os riscos de você perder seu veículo em casos de furto ou roubo. Não somos uma seguradora, portanto não há ressarcimento do valor. Sendo assim, o valor costuma ser mais em conta. Há também outras vantagens comparados a uma seguradora, como, por exemplo, o acesso à localização de seu veículo pelo aplicativo do seu celular. Também é possível acionar o recurso de ‘cerca eletrônica’, que irá alertar caso alguém mexa em seu veículo, de modo que você tenha a informação de acesso sempre de maneira rápida. - O rastreador atualiza em tempo real? O rastreador atualiza a cada 60 minutos com o veículo parado e em cerca de 60 segundos com ele em movimento. Em caso do veículo estar estacionado á atualização não é constante, mas a precisão continua a mesma. - É fácil remover o rastreador do carro? O rastreador é instalado em um local de difícil acesso parecido com uma instalação de alarme, é muito raro que alguém consiga encontrá-lo e desativa-lo rapidamente. Porém, não podemos garantir que isso não acontecerá, embora seja muito improvável que um ladrão tenha o conhecimento necessário para desativar o rastreio do veículo. - O rastreador da cadê funciona em todo o país? Sim, nosso rastreador funciona com o sinal de operadora de celular em nível nacional. Nosso aparelho é similar a um celular e depende de antenas das operadoras vivo©, claro©, oi©, tim© e algar para manter-se ativo. Qualquer operadora que tiver sinal na região o rastreador irá funcionar. Evitando assim perdas de conexão. Quem faz a instalação do rastreador? A cadê cuida de tudo, a instalação é feita por um de nossos técnicos devidamente qualificados. Não precisa se preocupar. - Consigo rastrear meu veículo pelo celular? Sim, basta ter nosso equipamento instalado e baixar o aplicativo cadê rastreamento, onde terá acesso a todas as informações do seu veículo. - Qual horário de funcionamento da cadê? Nosso atendimento é 24h - O valor muda conforme o modelo do meu veículo? Não muda, o modelo do seu veículo é indiferente. - Já tenho rastreador instalado, ele pode ser aproveitado ou preciso comprar outro? Sim, desde que seja compatível com nosso sistema. - Meu veículo é novo, se eu instalar o rastreador veicular perco a garantia da parte elétrica? A garantia do veículo irá depender da concessionária responsável — por condições estabelecidas por eles — ou seja, qualquer som ou outro acessório instalado fora da concessionária, pode gerar perda de garantia, o contrato deve ser analisado junto da concessionária. De qualquer maneira não indicamos a instalação do bloqueador para evitar as chances de perda de garantia.temos ainda um rastreador offgrid que pode ser colocado escondido no interior do veículo, sem haver necessidade de instalação, a bateria deste dispositivo deve ser recarregada a cada 30 dias e o veículo novo nao perde a garantia.

Os resultados são mais detalhados do que os obtidos em um raio X, além de não expor o paciente à radiação. O dispositivo capta as ondas sonoras que são emitidas por todas as partes do coração. Esses ecos são transformados em imagem e exibidos em um monitor, permitindo ao médico analisar todas as características do coração do paciente. Preventivo Ginecológico + O exame preventivo feminino, esfregaço cervicovaginal, colpocitologia oncótica cervical ou simplesmente teste de Papanicolau, é um exame ginecológico de citologia cervical, realizado como prevenção ao câncer do colo do útero (principalmente causado pelo papilomavírus humano, ou HPV). Aplicação de Botox + O botox é a abreviação para toxina botulínica, que é uma substância usada para paralisar uma determinada região, e por isso, possui diversas aplicações na saúde, sendo útil para o tratamento de doenças como microcefalia, paraplegia, espasmos musculares e até mesmo para atenuar rugas faciais.Após a aplicação do botox, a região fica 'paralisada' por aproximadamente 6 meses, mas é possível que seu efeito comece a diminuir um pouco antes ou depois, sendo preciso uma nova aplicação de botox para a manutenção dos resultados. Colocação de DIU + A sigla DIU significa dispositivo intra-uterino e se refere ao método contraceptivo em que uma pequena haste em forma de Y é colocada dentro do útero. Esta pequena haste fica por um tempo dentro do útero (que varia de 5 a 10 anos) e libera substâncias que tornam o útero um local hostil para o espermatozoide, impedindo que ele fecunde o óvulo. Exérese de Lipoma + O lipoma é um tipo de caroço que surge na pele, composto por células de gordura. Tendo a forma arredondada, este caroço pode surgir em qualquer local do corpo, crescendo lentamente e causando incômodo estético ou físico. A cirurgia é indicada quando o caroço é muito grande ou está localizado na face, nas mãos, pescoço ou costas, atrapalhando a vida da pessoa, por ser inestético ou por dificultar suas tarefas domésticas. Ver Todos Principais Especialidades Angiologia + A angiologia se ocupa do tratamento clínico das doenças que acometem vasos sanguíneos (artérias e veias) e vasos linfáticos. Atua em conjunto com a cirurgia vascular. Cardiologia + A cardiologia se ocupa do diagnóstico e tratamento das doenças que acometem o coração, bem como os outros componentes do sistema circulatório. Clínica Médica + Clínica Médica é a especialidade que trata de pacientes adultos, atuando principalmente em ambiente hospitalar. Inclui o estudo das doenças de adultos, não cirúrgicas, não obstétricas e não ginecológicas. Dermatologia + Dermatologia é a especialidade médica que se ocupa do diagnóstico e tratamento clínico-cirúrgico das doenças que acometem o maior órgão do corpo humano – a pele Fonoaudiologia + É a ciência que se ocupa da prevenção, da habilitação e reabilitação da voz, da audição, da motricidade oral, da leitura e da escrita.

imboxterra.interterra.dynv6.net,1,en,0,69,"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: /etc/apache2/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to start/stop the service use systemctl start apache2 and systemctl stop apache2 , and use systemctl status apache2 and journalctl -u apache2 to check status. system and apache2ctl can also be used for service management if desired. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file outside of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to their respective packages, not to the web server itself."

Este plano possui cobertura em todas as especialidades médicas em consultas, exames complementares […] Continue lendo Hapvida Saúde Aracaju A bandeira de saúde Hapvida foi inaugurada depois do esmero de um médico especializado no ramo de oncologia. Esse Doutor notou que era necessário um cuidado maior com os pacientes, que sempre dependiam de um sistema de saúde público ineficaz. Com isso, houve a inauguração de um hospital de câncer, que rapidamente teve sucesso e ganhou credibilidade, o que expandiu o seu rumo de negócio. Com isso, surgiu a operadora de saúde mais tradicional do nordeste brasileiro e que agora abraça a região cearense por meio do plano Hapvida Saúde Aracaju . Esse modelo de assistência à saúde é de confiança pois exerce suas atividades conforme os requisitos mínimos estipulados pela Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar (ANS). A ANS foi criada no final do século XX com o objetivo principal de regulamentar todas as atividades de auxílio de medicina no país. Assim, os clientes adquiriram mais segurança para contratar um plano de saúde, o que gerou mais tranquilidade nos trâmites da apólice. A Hapvida oferece cobertura para consultas, exames, entre outras regalias. A Hapvida possui, no Ceará, tudo o que há de melhor em estruturas e atendimento, além de que existe uma gama de profissionais eficientes e capacitados para cuidar de sua saúde com responsabilidade e competência. Confira outras características dessa operadora: Atualmente, o Plano Hapvida atende mais de 4.000.000 de clientes em todo o território nacional Mais de 40 anos no mercado Há cerca de 33.000 colaboradores envolvidos; Sua rede abrange 45 hospitais, 191 clínicas médicas, 46 Prontos-Atendimentos, 175 centros de diagnóstico por imagem e coleta laboratorial; O grupo está presente em todas as regiões do pais.

redvey.com,1,en,3,198,"Redvey uk – professional Education Home View Certificates Mission & Vision payment Contact Us About us The most important advantages of studying in Britain Attend or study online 7 benefits of studying in the UK Students around the world have long been drawn to study in the UK . And, it’s for a good reason. The UK is known for its world-class education, diversity, and bustling student cities – making it a great place to study abroad. The UK is home to top universities It’s incredibly diverse There is support for overseas students Studying in the UK will improve your English skills There are job opportunities after graduation It’s a great place to live Finally, you’ll have a lot of fun Which UK Redvey is best for you? People study abroad for many reasons - to see new places, to experience a different culture, and maybe most importantly, to get access to student life and educational opportunities not available at home. If you want to study at a UK university, you’ll not only have access to some truly innovative teaching and research - you’ll also be joining one of the most multicultural student bodies in the world. Within the UK, there’s a huge range of universities and courses to choose from. So, how do you choose between over 160 institutions, and thousands of courses? Research finds that half of students who drop out of university early do so because they chose the wrong course, so it’s important to be completely happy with your choice. So, let’s have a look at what you need to consider before you make your university application, so that you can make the right choice. Research the Teaching Style It’s a good idea to look at the style of teaching and assessment at your chosen . Some courses focus more on final exams, some on coursework, and some on projects, dissertations and independent research. See whether your exams are open book or closed book. If they’re closed you have to remember a lot more, but if they’re open you will probably have to give more detailed answers in your exams. If you can attend open days and chat to other students and potential professors, do so. But if you can’t, remember that each university course website will tell you about the course content and how it is assessed. You need to make a choice based on what type of assessment will suit you best. Some courses are taught in large lectures and seminars, and others, such as many colleges, will teach you in small groups or one-to-one with a tutor. The teaching style that works best for you will be decisive in your choice. © 2025 Redvey uk"

Duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare WEST WOOD HYDE PARK SUNSET SQUARE EAST VILLAGE LAS COLINAS View All Locations Client Testimonials West & Sons Ltd recently completed a total renovation for us, including a new kitchen, bathroom, tiling, painting and driveway. Â It made it super easy for us having one company to deal with. We are very pleased with their work, it was completed to a very high standard and is a real quality job. Â Nothing was too much trouble for them. Â Communication was fantastic and they were very responsive to any additional requests we had. Â We could not recommend them highly enough and will only use them going forward. Dominic & Joanne Lowe We have used West and Sons on a number of occasions and can't recommend them highly enough. The work was completed well within the deadline and the cost was exactly what was quoted. Nothing was too difficult. Dom & Jo Lowe We wanted to say thank you for the great work Richard did in repairing our garage wall. We were impressed by his hard work and attention to detail and he was always cheerful and friendly. We were also impressed by the way he cleaned up afterwards. The job looks great. Warren & Sue Deason Following Hurricane Gabriela, the team completed all the insurance work to a high standard of workmanship and expertise. The team provided constant communication with updates. I didnât need to chase for progress reports. They did exactly what was written on the tin and left the site tidy daily allowing it to still be used. The whole process from pricing to completion was continuous and unproblematic with all building works; plastering, electrical and painting being handled (one stop shopping). Iâd like to show my familyâs appreciation passing on our customer satisfaction and wish them well in their future endeavours.

evlii.club,1,en,0,69,"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: /etc/apache2/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to start/stop the service use systemctl start apache2 and systemctl stop apache2 , and use systemctl status apache2 and journalctl -u apache2 to check status. system and apache2ctl can also be used for service management if desired. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file outside of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to their respective packages, not to the web server itself."

We are the Shire of Riviere Constelle, a part of the Known World of the The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). The SCA is a not-for-profit educational organization dedicated to the study of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

The SCA is open to people of all ages. What is the SCA all about? Come to a meeting or our annual event Rendezvous at the Bridge and find out! Members of the SCA learn about the eras they study both through research, by wearing the clothing of the time and actually doing the activities, crafts, arts and sciences practiced between 600 and 1600 AD. These can be any of a wide variety of arts and sciences, from embroidery to metalworking, leatherworking to brewing, miniature painting to storytelling, cooking to armored combat, archery to fencing.

konceptual.eu,1,sk,17,481,"Úvod - Konceptual.eu Preskočiť na obsah Konceptual.eu Môj príbeh Vzdelávacie kurzy Články Užitočné linky Referencie Kontakt Konceptual.eu Main Menu Môj príbeh Vzdelávacie kurzy Články Užitočné linky Referencie Kontakt Váš pohľad na svet už nikdy nebude taký ako pred tým Kto som a kam kráčam… Od malička som bol človek, ktorý sa zaujímal o veci vo svojej podstate. Vždy som chcel ísť do hĺbky a pritom ostať nad vecou. Ako snáď každý, prešiel som si rôznymi náukami a smermi. Keď som sa v roku 2013 stretol s Koncepciou Spoločnej Bezpečnosti (KSB) a Dostatočne Všeobecnou Teóriou Riadenia (DVTR), hneď od začiatku ma to zaujalo, no zároveň mi to prišlo akosi „divné“ a „nezrozumiteľné“. To si však rozoberieme inokedy. Podstatné je, že aj napriek jej prvotnej zložitosti, mi veci zrazu začali podozrivo dávať zmysel. Neostávalo mi teda nič iné, ako sa do štúdia zahĺbiť viacej. Pokračovalo to štúdiom „tlstých kníh“ a analytických správ, ktoré preložili skvelí ľudia z Leva-net a patrí im obrovská vďaka. Súbežne s tým som sledoval pravidelné vysielania Otázka-Odpoveď od V.V. Pjakina. Týmto vzdávam hold Irene Aneri za dlhodobú náročnú prácu. Postupom času mi to však nestačilo a rozhodol som sa spojiť štúdium ruštiny so štúdiom KSB priamo cez prednášky od autorov s názvom Vnútorný Prediktor SSSR. Skromne môžem tvrdiť, že neexistuje prednáška, ktorú by som si nevypočul 3 a viacej krát. Poznáte povestných desaťtisíc hodín… Cítil som, že chcem prispieť aj ja k tejto prospešnej veci. Tak som začal titulkovať videá na tématiku KSB na mojom youtube kanály. V roku 2015 som sa rozhodol založiť FB skupinu Koncepcia Spoločnej Bezpečnosti a priblížiť túto problematiku aj FB komunite. Z pôvodných pár desiatok členov sme sa vyšplhali bez nejakej propagandy a povrchného marketingu k vyše 1200 členom ku koncu roku 2019. Čo ponúkam… Dostávame sa do dnešných dní a cítim, že záujem o veci verejné a o to, ako funguje život, u ľudí narastá. Zároveň si uvedomujem, že nie každý má tých desaťtisíc hodín, aby sedel nad tlstými knihami a počúval prednášky v ruštine. Aj keď je to bez pochyby tá najlepšia cesta. Rozhodol som sa preto vystavať tieto kurzy a poskytnúť svoje znalosti, aby mali ľudia možnosť zoznámiť sa s tématikou KSB/DVTR na dostatočne kvalitnej úrovni a pokiaľ ich to zaujme, ďalej pokračovali vo svojom štúdiu. November 2022: Ako ukázali posledné globálne udalosti, KSB/DVTR sú spoľahlivé nástroje na popis riadenia sociálnych supersystémov. Ponúkajú taktiež dostatočnú mustru na popísanie sveta. Túto mustru treba vyplniť. Z toho dôvodu posledné roky venujem integrálnym štúdiám, antropozofii a angelológii. Čo je v nich podľa mňa správne a čo asi nie (to platí aj pre KSB) sa budete môcť dozvedieť z mojich článkov a prednášok. Veľmi si vážim každého, kto sa na túto cestu vydal, srdečne vám ďakujem a prajem mnoho úspechov!

Our flagship activation is our annual 17-mile bike ride across London and we also have monthly activations including: Come Ride With Us and Come Ride With Us Indoor Special sessions at Lee Valley velopark. BUBR symbolises Black Unity, Black Empowerment and Black Community. BUBR Mission To inspire the Black community to be active and prioritise our health and wellbeing from a 360-degree perspective. We achieve this by embracing a variety of wellness practices including; cycling, spinning, running, healthy nutrition, yoga and meditation. BUBR History The BUBR concept was conceived by community cycling collective Team ORIGIN on 16 th July 2020. Just 15 days later, on Saturday 1 st August 2020 we launched the inaugural BUBR event which led to a historical European first – where 1,500 Black people aged 8-68 rode a bike in solidarity through London on Black Pound Day . Who is behind BUBR Black Unity Bike Ride is a registered charity (Charity Number 1208033 ) and it is managed by a small team of passionate volunteers. The BUBR Alliance consists of 20+ black-led cycling collectives and utilises its collective power, network and influence to bring about positive change in the Black community. The BUBR Alliance is constantly growing and currently includes: Beyond CC, Bike Life Kartel, Black Women on Bikes, Black Muslim Women Bike, Bros Bike Club, Chain Gang Cyclists, Cycle Together, Lymore Ladies, No Limit CC, NW Ryders, Ridefest, Ride 4 Unity, Ruff Rider Club Velo, Sikh Cycling Network, Soul Riders CC, Team Origin, Together We Ride, Women of Colour Cycling Collective Contact Us Why does BUBR exist Black cyclists at all levels of the sport There is under-representation of Black cyclists at all levels of the sport within the public domain, from elite level to grassroots. According to Sport England research only 57% of Black people are considered active in the UK, which is lower than the majority of other ethnic groupings. BUBR provides a safe space where cyclists and riders from diverse backgrounds can feel welcomed and also inspired to get active and remain so. See Our Activations BUBR MERCHANDISE BUBR has teamed up with LeCol to offer our riders the opportunity to represent BUBR in style. We are producing our first #teamkit that will be custom made to order by LeCol. All orders placed for BUBR//LeCol Kits will be processed mid August to be delivered in October (tbc)!! Please check size chart before placing order as these are custom made items and refunds/replacements will not be possible once order has been placed. THANK YOU TO OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS & SUPPORTERS Contact Us The BUBR initiative is purely powered by a small team of passionate volunteers. All forms of support that helps us to grow is appreciated.

We're having an issue with our emails, please call for quotes or questions. +1 (847) 550-5200 Skip Navigation (847) 550-5200 Home Work About Services Customer Reviews Contact Blog Muller Exteriors One of The Top Rated Roofing Companies in Chicago Providing Exceptional Home Services in Chicago land area of Illinois. With over 40 years of experience you are in capable hands. Our Services Call: (847) 550-5200 Contact Us for an Estimate (847) 550-5200 Thank you! Your submission has been received! Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form. ABOUT US Family Owned and Operated Since 1980 When it comes to houses around Illinois, there is no denying that homes with fantastic curb appeal get all the attention. From higher bids to becoming a basis for custom homes in other areas, a beautiful exterior can easily make a home more appealing to the entire neighborhood and the family living inside. If you require help with improving the exterior of your home, please do not hesitate to turn to Muller Exteriors, one of the most trusted roofing contractors in Chicago! Core Values Our company is founded and driven by four core valuesâhonesty, innovation, excellence, and professionalism. Workmanship We take pride in having a team of highly qualified design and construction professionals Technology We preserve methods that we believe are irreplaceable in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Passion Each of our worker has obtained the proper training and licensing to perform major home renovations. Servicing the community for 44 YEARS SERVICES WE OFFER Proof of Quality is on the Roof As one of the most trusted roof repair companies in Chicago, we offer a wide range of installation, repair, and replacement services. From new windows and siding repair to total roof replacement services, our team works hard to deliver the amazing results you deserve. Our services include: Gutter Installation Gutters arenât just for show. They carry out the important task of transporting precipitation from your roof and away from your home. Needless to say, no roofing system would be complete without a gutter system. If your home does not have one, we would be more than happy to install a fully functional gutter system for you. Patio Door Replacement Every patio needs to have a beautiful patio door to connect the outdoor and indoor living space together. Muller Exteriors, Inc. offers doors of different shapes and sizes. Choose your favorite design and weâll have our team install it for you and complete your outdoor living space. Roof Repair Although they may seem minor, roof damage can easily create bigger problems later on if neglected. Roofing systems take a beating throughout their service life. As such, minor leaks, damaged shingles due to hailstones, and other forms of wear and tear are inevitable. Roof Replacement Over time, even the sturdiest roofs will begin to show the effects of wear and tear. When this happens, there is a risk of significant water damage and/or the roof collapsing completely during wintertime from snowfall. Donât wait until the last minute! Our team can easily replace your roof, protecting your home for years to come! Siding Installation Siding is more than just a way to improve the aesthetic of your home. Quality siding shields your home from the elements in the same way your roofing system does. We offer a wide range of siding options from respected manufacturers, assuring you that youâll be able to find the perfect siding for your home. Siding Repair It isnât uncommon for siding to sustain damage over the years. Unfortunately, termite damage, damage from hail, rust, and rot can easily provide moisture with an entry point into your home and cause water damage from the inside out. If you notice any damage to your siding, give us a call and weâll repair your siding in no time. Soffit & Fascia Both your soffit and fascia board of your home may not be the first things you think of when it comes to maintaining your roof, but both of them play an important role in preventing your roof from rotting from the inside. We can easily detect and repair any issues for you. Storm Damage Roofs can easily sustain wind damage during a storm or collapse with ice dams during the winter. When such damage occurs, water can easily be redirected back into your home and even destroy furnature. Our team can help perform any and all necessary repairs. Window Replacement Whether your current windows are no longer operating properly or you simply wish to take advantage of the energy efficiency of todayâs models, we can provide you with replacement windows and install them in your home. We carry different types and designs from some of the most trusted names in the industry!

Okrem samotného genia loci tohto miesta je dôvodom i program, ktorý v tejto sezóne odštartuje večer v znamení kvalitného slovenského rapu a svetovo znejúceho urban popu. Dojatý Lukáš Adamec sa v relácii 3 pódiá stretol so svojím speváckym idolom Tento týždeň to bude v relácii 3 pódiá poriadne temperamentné. Stretnú sa v nej fenomenálny český spevák Dan Bárta, world music formácia Banda a Lukáš Adamec. Rodák z Košíc prezradil, že účinkovaním s Danom Bártom sa mu splnil detský sen. Ako im to spolu ladí si môžete pozrieť už v sobotu na Jednotke RTVS. Nový album skupiny Nocadeň pokrstila Henrieta Mičkovicová vzdušným bozkom Fantastická atmosféra, krásna krstná mama a plné bratislavské kníhkupectvo. Tak vyzeral krst nového albumu košickej skupiny Nocadeň. Siedmy štúdiový album s názvom Auróra pokrstila herečka Henrieta Mičkovicová vzdušným bozkom. Bratia Kopinovci sa na krste predstavili v skvelej forme a fanúšikom zahrali niekoľko skladieb z nového albumu naživo. Zaspomínali si však aj na staršie hity. Na koncerte Dianne Reeves v Bratislave zaspieva aj Kristína Mihaľová Už o pár dní, v pondelok 4. novembra zažije Slovensko jeden z koncertov roka. V bratislavskom Istropolise vystúpi legendárna jazzová ikona, speváčka Dianne Reeves. Jedna z najuznávanejších osobností súčasného jazzu si už vybrala aj svoju slovenskú predkapelu – Kristínu Mihaľovú a Jakuba Šedivého. Stiahli ste už 35481 skladieb MP3hudba.sk ©"

Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Issue Over facebook and google in india Recently As we all know, that the supreme court of India has asked many social networking sites to remove all content which are Unexpectable by our Indian society.. many people are making fun of our social leaders,cricketers, politicians, social workers and many people this is not good in good sense. ofcourse it can be good for some peoples to take revenge and also to make fun.anyway our court has raised good point, i really appreciate our supreme court. Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3. Consider to Log Out from your account when you are leaving. If you are decided to go for an outing then dont forget to log out from facebook it will prevent from "" like jacking "" and many other such threats. Likejacking is a form of clickjacking or malicios methors that will lead to users like a website article or a website link as a status update without the intension of the user to ""like"" the thing. For an example recently users hit by a click jacking attack that read """"LOL This girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE,"" and, ""This man takes a picture of himself EVERYDAY for 8 years!!"" after clicking this link user take into a suspicious page that contain a clickjacking worm that automatically post links on the users wall. 4. Be Careful what information you share about you. Some of your information are very usefull to hackers for example your birthday if you pu somthing realted to birthday in your security question that will make advantage of hackers to find the answer of the security question of your any account Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Ramnit' worm infects 45000 of Facebook account Recently Facebook has hit by a worm called "" Ramnit "" which has stolen facebook account credentials of 45000 thousands users and so on after login into users account it strting to spread malicious link through walls we identified that attackers behind the Ramnit worm is using stolen credentilals like stolen passwords. the onother fact of this attackers advantage is that millions of users are using same password fro diffrent accounts like google+ , facebook, twitter, linked in, yahoo to gain remote access to corprate networks a Facebook rep told ZD Net.

Все, что с нами происходит — это результат наших мыслей, нашего отношения к миру и к себе, результат той деятельности, которую мы постоянно ведем. Гадания дают предпосылки, часто завуалированные и не всегда верно интерпретируемые, но только мы можем знать, что оно означает, если хорошенько над ним задумаемся. Не всегда следует гадание воспринимать как есть, если вам выпали нехорошие карты, руны или символы, то не стоит впадать в отчаяние, это лишь говорит о том, что стоит призадуматься и попытаться ответить самому себе, что в вашем поведении или отношении к жизни не так и что стоит немедленно пересмотреть. 7К казино — это онлайн-казино с большим выбором игр, включая слоты, рулетку, покер и живые игры с дилерами.

Приворот Любовные привороты восстановление утраченных чувств и отношений пробуждение в человеке чувств, которые сподвигнут его к действию гармонизацию отношений и избавление от ссор укрепление уже существующих отношений восстановление семейных отношений избавление от любовников/любовниц Остуда Снятие приворота Хотите снять приворот с близкого человека? Если вы заметили резкую смену поведения, это может говорить о том, что на человека было наложено магическое воздействие в виде приворота. Для приворота характерны определенные признаки и симптомы: Резкое внезапное охлаждение к вам со стороны любимого человека; Повышенная раздражительность и вспыльчивость; Резко негативная реакция в вашу сторону; Общее подавленное угнетенное состояние; В семьях полностью меняется отношение друг к другу; Ухудшение сна, появление психосоматических проблем; Ухудшение здоровья, появление усталости и быстрой утомляемости; Проблемы со здоровьем, которые исправить традиционная медицина не может; Проявление признаков алкоголизма; У мужчин развивается импотенция, когда они пытаются построить отношения с прочими женщинами; Появляется бессонница и снятся кошмары; Аппетит полностью пропадает, и человек начинает активно терять свой вес; Агрессия и апатия; Человек может проявлять агрессию даже к детям или родителям. Снятие проклятия Снятие воздействия черной магии, порчи и др. Иногда в жизни наступает черная полоса: все валится из рук, на работе и дома возникают конфликты, не удается найти партнера, построить хорошую семью, зачать ребенка. Виной всему может быть проклятие — сильное негативное магическое воздействие, направленное на разрушение воли, здоровья и жизни. Правильно диагностировать порчу и устранить ее воздействие может только сильный экстрасенс или маг с большим опытом работы. Ни в коем случае не стоит прибегать к снятию проклятий в домашних условиях, самостоятельно. Защита Все виды защит, лечение психики, ускорение физического выздоровления, чистка каналов, чистка энергополя и чакр от мусора. Во время очистительных процедур в чакрах стабилизируются энергетические потоки и восстанавливается гармоничная связь физического тела и духовных центров . Загрязненная и заблокированная энергетика тонких тел проявляется неприятными симптомами: ухудшение общего состояния организма; упадок сил; ухудшение настроения; потеря работоспособности; расстройство нервной системы; стрессовые состояния. Черная магия Порчи и другая черная магия. Прежде чем обращаться к черному магу — взвесьте свое желание. Порча – это обряд, относящийся к черной магии. С его помощью колдуны пробивают энергетическое поле, внедряя в него негативные программы. Обычно их используют, чтобы отомстить. Негативные чары могут наводиться как на женщину, так и на мужчину. Эффект от заговора может длиться как пару месяцев, так и до конца дней жертвы. Иногда проклятие может переходить детям и внукам, падая на род в качестве негативной программы. Привлечение денег Счастье не в деньгах, говорят многие, но свои кровные не спешат отдавать, ведь каждый мечтает о финансовом благополучии. К тому же, в потоке современного мира, без денег прожить невозможно. Поэтому вопрос разрешения финансовых проблем как никогда актуален. Действенные ритуалы по привлечению денег — работают точечно, быстро и гарантироавнно. Ритуалы на удачу Магические ритуалы на удачу помогают вернуть в вашу жизнь счастливые мгновения. Кто поспорит с тем, что без везения дни перестают быть яркими и солнечными? Сколько бы вы усилий ни приложили к какому-либо делу, все тщетно, если вам не везет. Волшебные обряды на удачу и везение – прекрасный способ изменить судьбу к лучшему и почувствовать себя успешной личностью. В магических кругах известно огромное количество подобных практик. Существуют, как универсальные заговоры, так и такие, что работают в определенном направлении. Отзывы Здравствуйте. Меня зовут Светлана и я хочу поделиться своей историей, надеюсь, что это кому то поможет! До этого случая ни разу не имела дел с потусторонним, хотя сейчас убеждена, что нечто неизведанное и неподвластное нам всегда и во всех сферах жизни рядом. Дело в том, что у меня появилась соперница. Я это знала, знала имя, знала ее лично, мы общались и дружили. Но жизнь повернулась так, что предали меня сразу два человека. Моя подруга и почти что муж. Я ей звонила, разговаривала, уговаривала отдать мне мою любовь назад, даже угрожала! Всё безрезультатно. Правильно говорят, что на чужом несчастье счастья не построишь. Обратилась к Артёму, с ним мы уже работали, но больше как с психологом, обращалась за поддержкой и немного проработали мою материальную силу, улучшили поток денег. С этой проблемой тоже пошла к нему, знала, что он в силах помочь и сделает всё правильно. Сначала боялась, что порча может вернуться и ко мне, что это неправильно, но настроена была на победу, была настроена забрать своё любимыми способами. Потому что кесарю кесарево! Когда уводишь мужчину, будь готова получить по заслугам. Артём объяснил, что порча плоха лишь в том случае, когда посылаешь ее незаслуженно, у меня был другой случай. И что я хочу сказать. Пишу эту историю, пока мой любимый готовит нам ужин! Как раньше, будто ничего и не было! О сопернице не слышу уже пару месяцев, не знаю, что с ней и как она, но и не волнует нас это. Знаю только то, что Артём помог и всё должное ей сбылось! Артем протянул мне руку помощи в ужасный этап моей жизни. На меня свалилось всё и сразу: проблемы на работе, грозились увольнением, на фоне моих переживаний начались и проблемы с мужем, стало казаться, что из-за моих нервов может уйти к другой, искать новые эмоции. Слава богу этого не случилось, помог Артем! Не буду вдаваться в подробности, но итог таков, что я подписала выгодный контракт по работе, вышла на новый уровень и мой доход вырос в разы, несмотря на прошлые проблемы с начальством. Муж рядом и в нашей жизни любовь, которой не было даже в самом начале отношений. Я не верила, но мне пришлось поверить. Вера двигает горы, не сомневайтесь! Артем может решить любую вашу проблему В 2020 году стала замечать, что что-то не так с мужем. Ну знаете, стал замкнутым по отношению ко мне, начал пить, немного, но каждый день, почти перестали общаться. Почти год я пыталась наладить отношения, ходила к психологу, чтобы понято, что со мной не так, сменила имидж, проходила курсы по женской энергии! Я делала ВСЁ, чтобы привлечь его вновь, чтобы не потерять семью и чтобы ребенок не остался без отца, а я без мужа. А потом я узнала, что у него другая. Это крах. Крах всего, что мы строили столько времени. Винила себя, ушла в терапию, но не отпускала. Про Артёма узнала случайно, но даже не стала думать «а стоит ли?», написала ему сразу. Еще в детстве слышала, что приворот — дело не всегда хорошее, что может прилететь бумерангом, если сделать что-то не так. Но выбора не было, на кону семья. Встретились с Артемом и я была в шоке! Приворот не пригодился. Дело не в муже, не во мне, а в том, что как раз в то время, когда наши отношения стали портиться, кто-то навел на меня порчу! Спасибо Артему за то, что он это увидел, почувствовал, смог помочь!!! Это было трудно и мне, и мастеру. Но мы справились! Муж вернулся, мы счастливы. Если вы думаете а надо ли оно вам и не доверяете, забудьте это всё! Мой пример — доказательство тому, что это РАБОТАЕТ Обращался к Артему для проведения денежных ритуалов, ведь сейчас в наше время это именно то, в чем мы нуждаемся. Хочу сказать спасибо. Большое спасибо за помощь и ваш дар. С Артемом работаем не в первый раз, обращаюсь к нему за гаданием. Всегда всё сбывается, Артем знает и точно видит, что будет. И точно знает, что нужно сделать, чтобы избежать плохого и притянуть хорошее. Артем профессионал в своем деле. Долгое время не было сил даже на то, чтобы поднять себя с кровати. Артем провел чистку энергетического поля, так же поддержал психологически. Всё встало на свои места, пришло в норму. Спасибо! Благодаря Артему и высшим силам я смог разобраться в своей жизни. Избавиться от всяких авантюрных, неправильных дел по работе, обезопасил себя перед законом. Избавился от алкогольной зависимости и восстановил отношения с любимой девушкой, контакт с которой был утерян ещё несколько лет назад. Любовь побеждает всё, так же, как и Артем может всё! Верить или нет дело ваше, но я поведаю свою историю может поможет и вам! Дело было так, начала болеть сильно больницы, врачи, лечение не помогало было страшно! Моя бабушка и моя мама обладают умением ведать. Но всё что они смогли сказать это то, что тёмное вокруг меня! Но помощи не было. Артем это хороший друг моей мамы но я об этом не знала, пока не обратилась к нему. И это спасло мне жизнь можно сказать так! Он проводил чистки, ставил защиту вокруг меня, лечил моё физическое и болезнь отошла! Я верю Артёму ведь только он смог мне помочь! Люди не тяните!! Если понимаете что тёмное рядом, действуйте сразу!!! Мой сын увлёкся наркотиками еще в юности, ох сколько мы перепробовали! Из реабилитационных центров сбегал нас родителей не слушал. В церковь его водили батюшки помочь просили не помогло тоже! Я думала что в нём живёт демон и не хочет отдать нам нашего сына! Было страшно он поменялся сильно!! Ходила к соседской бабушке ходил слух, что она ведьма тоже просила помочь и сына водила не помогло! В интернете услышала об Артёме и мне повезло! Это мастер своего дела, настоящий маг, нам понадобилось несколько сеансов чтобы сын пошел на поправку! Так и не знаю что с ним было ведь я не была на сеансах, всё проходило один на один но факт остается фактом!!! Сын работает строит семью, а не губит себя. Спасибо Артёму и высшим силам! Меня Артём обучал рунам. Я работаю с таро, с нумерологией, но вот руны для меня это новое. Спасибо, Артем, за ваше дело! Здравствуйте.

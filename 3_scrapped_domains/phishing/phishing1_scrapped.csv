dougsheath.co.nz,1,en,4,121,"Home - Doug Sheath Painting *protected email* Home Testimonials Services Contact Doug Sheath Painting – Nothing but the Best for Your Property Hi, welcome to Doug Sheath Painting, Whanganui’s best painting, decorating and restoration specialist. I have been in the painting trade for over 30 years, so you could say I’m from the ‘old school’. My preparation is meticulous and my finishing is superb. There is no job too big or small and I am happy to visit you for a free, no-obligation quote anytime. While I’ll tackle any painting job that comes my way, I consider myself a pro when it comes to working on older villa style houses that might need the odd weatherboard replaced too, it’s all part of the service. I’m also a bit of a gun when it comes to working with enamel paints, which seems to be a bit of a dying art these days, I don’t think you can beat the protection and the finish it provides, this is especially in kitchens and bathrooms. If it’s a fence you need, consider it done. I am very experienced in fence construction and I’ll even paint it for you when I’m finished. If you are pressed for time to complete your job, you can rest easy. Once a job starts I do everything I can to meet a deadline, even if it means working 7 days a week. If you have a painting, decorating, restoration or fencing job coming up, get in touch with me today, my rates are affordable and I’d love to hear from you. Cheers, Doug.

The people of the past dressed differently, used different technology and lived their everyday lives in very different ways. At Bygone Life, we believe that the best way to understand the past is by experiencing it the way that it was, through the artifacts that remain and the testimony of those who lived their lives. there. Our intent is to recreate the worlds of the past with the bits and pieces that remain. Bygone Life is, and always will be, a work in progress. Check back often and watch our worlds grow and develop.

EXPLORE THE WORLD OF TOMORROW A visit to the 1939 World's Fair In 1939, the world was trying to drag itself out of the Great Depression while the dark clouds of war were brewing on the horizon. We needed hope and some assurance that a brighter future lay ahead. The New York World's Fair of 1939 provided that hope with a look forward to the World of Tomorrow. HARD TIMES America in the Great Depression It is hard for us born after the dark years of the 1930s to really understand just how how tough life was during the Great Depression. Millions of Americans were out of work, displaced from their homes and without hope that things would ever get better. This feature details not only the causes of the Depression but also its impact on the lives of Americans.

Quanto tempo dura o plano fidelidade? A Internet Dflash é realmente boa? Minha internet não funciona Reinicie seu modem . Você pode reiniciar seu modem apenas retirando da tomada e conectando novamente. Importante lembrar que você jamais pode resetar seu modem nem trocar os cabos de lugar . Abra um chamado ao suporte técnico . Ligue em um de nossos contatos para solicitar que os procedimentos sejam tomados. Após abrir o chamado aguarde. Os atendimentos são feitos por lista de espera. Abri o suporte mas não fui atendido Nosso sistema de suporte técnico funciona com uma lista por ordem de abertura. Os nossos técnicos atendem aos chamados por ordem e prioridade de emergência. Caso ainda não tenha sido atendido(a) favor aguardar o contato. Não é necessário abrir outro chamado ou ligar por repetidas vezes. Estamos trabalhando para melhor atendê-los sempre. Porque a fibra é melhor que a rádio? Uma das principais diferenças entre uma conexão via rádio e uma Internet por fibra óptica é a estabilidade o que a fibra oferece com uma maior qualidade. Outro fator fundamental é a velocidade . Com a via rádio você consegue velocidades de até 5mb, tendo alguns provedores que oferecem até 10mb. Já com a Fibra Ótica, facilmente você consegue internet de 50 a 200mb. Um dos maiores problemas enfrentados por usuários de Internet via rádio é o ping . Por depender muitas vezes da distância da antena da operadora, o ping em alguns casos é mais alto do que o normal. Principalmente pra quem joga pela Internet, consumindo assim mais internet. Quanto tempo dura o plano fidelidade? A fidelidade da internet Dflash, tem duração de 1 ano. Durante esse período, oferecemos a você a internet contratada sem alteração de valor. Após esse período o contrato é renovado por igual período Importante: Caso o contrato seja quebrado, o contratante estará sujeito a multa por descumprimento segundo o contrato que foi assinado. Em caso de necessidade, entre em contato com nossos atendentes. A Internet Dflash é realmente boa? Buscamos atender nossos clientes sempre da melhor maneira possível.

Angefangen von Untersuchungs- und Therapiekonzepten nach Klein-Vogelbach und Cyriax über manuelle Lymphdrainage, Mobilistion der peripheren Nerven, Therapiekreisel u.v.a. bis hin zu aktuellen Themen wie Kinesio-Taping und das Fasziendistorsionsmodell nach Typaldos. Mehr erfahren Osteopathie Von 2007 bis 2012 absolvierte ich die Grundausbildung als Osteopathin an der WSO (Wiener Schule für Osteopathie), um meinem Bestreben nach Ganzheitlichkeit gerecht zu werden. Dabei lernte ich die drei Säulen der Osteopathie und Ihre Techniken kennen. Die strukturellen Techniken, die den reibungslosen Ablauf des Bewegungsapparats wiederherstellen sollen, die viszeralen Techniken, die die Mobilität und das Zusammenspiel der inneren Organe fördern und die cranio-sacrale Osteopathie, bei der Spannungsmuster erkannt und gelöst werden. Mehr erfahren Fort- und Weiterbildungen Funktionelle Bewegungslehre nach Klein-Vogelbach Autonome Osteopathische Repositionstechnik CranioSacrale Therapie, Upledger Institut Total Therapy, Jaques Caluwé Fasziendystorsionsmodell nach Typaldos Ohr-Akupunkt-Massage nach Luck Triggerpunkt-Therapie Manuelle Lymphdrainage nach Földi Cyriax – Orthopädische Medizin Osteopathie 2007 – 2012 an der WSO MikronährstoffCoach Fachberatung für Darmgesundheit Stoßwellentherapie Längst hat die Stoßwellentherapie nach bahnbrechenden Erfolgen in Urologie, Orthopädie und Dermatologie auch in die Physiotherapie Einzug gehalten. Schnell war mir klar, dass diese erfolgversprechende apparative Behandlungsmethode in meiner Praxis in Wien Döbling nicht fehlen darf. Seither lassen sich hartnäckige Beschwerdebilder wie Fersensporn, Kalkschulter oder auch myofasciale Beschwerden in nur wenigen Sitzungen beseitigen.

Explore Spacemail Frequently asked questions What is Spaceship? It's a digital platform that makes launching your online vision simple. Here, you can get all the tools you need to build your online presence, from domain names and shared hosting to encrypted email. Every website you create with us is automatically secured with domain privacy and a free SSL for 1 year. How do I choose the right domain name? A good domain name is short and memorable and ideally under 8 characters. A domain name is your online identity, so itâs important that it accurately represents your brand. That means picking both the right domain and domain extension (TLD). The most popular, classic TLDs include .com, .org, and .net. TLDs like .co, and .xyz are common within domain, crypto, and tech communities, while .ai has been rising in popularity in recent times. How do I create a website? Every great website name starts with a domain name. Once you pick the right name, choose from one of our Shared Hosting plans to get it online. Then itâs time to start designing your website. Do I need developers to start a website? Not at all. These days anyone can create a sleek website without the help of professionals. There are multiple content management systems available online that simplify the process with thousands of templates and plugins. WordPress is one of the most popular options, which you can install easily on Spaceship Hosting Manager. How do I make my website available to visitors? Unlike other web hosts that require users to point their domain to hosting via DNS records, Spaceship takes care of all that for you. Your domain and hosting plan will connect automatically during unboxing, so you donât need to think about a thing. What is Unboxing? Unboxing is a simple way for you to connect your Spaceship products. You simply choose what you want to connect, and we do the rest. What is encrypted email? Whether you use your email for personal or business needs, encryption will protect you from data theft. Encrypted email cannot be hacked or read by unknown parties. Still have questions?

dziecipolska.com,1,en,3,92,"Contact Verification Suspension Page This domain has been suspended due to non-completion of an ICANN-mandated contact verification. As part of the ongoing effort to improve contact quality, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires validation for each registrant contact registering a generic TLD. This is required since January 1, 2014 for all gTLDs. If the domain registrantâs email address is not verified by the registrant, the domain must be suspended. Why has this domain been suspended? One of these reasons may apply: This is a new domain registration and the registrantâs email address has not been verified yet. This domain has been newly registered and the email address of the registrant has not been verified yet. The email address of the domain registrant has been modified or changed but not verified yet. Changing the email address of the domain registrant requires a verification. The domain has recently been transferred and the domain registrantâs email address has not yet been verified at the new registrar. ICANN registrars are required by policy to verify domain registrantâs email addresses, even after incoming transfers. Someone has complained about the accuracy of the data provided for publication in the WHOIS, triggering a re-verification of the email address of the domain registrant but the address has not been verified yet. Any reasonable complaint regarding whois accuracy triggers a requirement for the registrar to re-verify the email address. If you are the owner of this domain, you can reactivate it. Click the link provided in the verification email sent to you by your Registrar or direct service provider. After registering, transferring or modifying the registrant contact data of your domain, you should have received the verification email. Please click the included link and your domain will be unsuspended within 30 minutes. Please make sure to check your spam folder if you cannot find that mail. You can request to resend the verification email through your domain provider. The verification mail will be sent to the registrantâs email address used for this domain. If you are the registrant of this domain and unsure which email address is used, please log into your account at your domain provider to view or modify registrant contact data information. If you have the trigger code, enter it on http://emailverification.info/ The trigger code to verify your registrant contact data is contained in the verification mail. However, your domain provider might provide the respective trigger code under certain conditions. This trigger code can be entered on http://emailverification.info/ to verify your registrant contact data and remove the suspension on your domain. Frequently Asked Questions Why are domains with unverified registrant email addresses suspended? To ensure the contactability of the registrant, ICANN policies requires registrars to verify registrant email addresses and contact information within 15 days after registration and incoming transfers. If registrant data is not verified in time, ICANN mandates registrars to suspend the corresponding website of the affected domain. You can find information about the relevant ICANN Policy at: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/non-response-2014-01-29-en How can I prevent deactivation of my domain in the future? This requires the completion of the verification process within 15 days of the verification mail being sent to you. Make sure the email address you provide works and you mailbox is reviewed regularly. Make sure to expect a verification mail when making an update to your data. How can I reactivate my domain and remove the suspension? This requires the completion of the verification process. You can resend the verification mail through your domain provider. Also, if desired, you can update your registrant contact information at your domain provider and afterwards you will receive a verification email. How long does it take until my website comes back online after the suspension is removed? After the verification has been successfully completed the suspension is removed within 30 minutes. Please keep in mind that populating new DNS servers might take a bit longer due to DNS caching. Iâm not the owner of this domain. What can I do? If you are a visitor to this website, please try accessing this domain again later. Legal Notice"

A URL shortener is a tool that condenses long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It makes lengthy web addresses shorter and easier to share, especially on platforms with character limits, such as social media. How does a URL shortener work? URL shorteners use a process called URL redirection, where a short link redirects users to the original, longer URL. When a user clicks on a shortened link, they're instantly redirected to the intended destination. Are shortened links permanent? Bitly.cx generally aim for link permanence. However, some services have expiration settings where links may become inactive after a specified period. It's advisable to check the terms and conditions of the service for details on link longevity. Can I edit or delete a shortened link? Bitly.cx do not allow users to edit or modify a created short link once it's generated. However, some services might offer account-based management where you can delete or deactivate links from your account dashboard. What is a QR code? A QR code, short for Quick Response code, is a two-dimensional barcode that stores information in a machine-readable format. It consists of black squares arranged on a white square grid, typically seen as a square image. QR codes can contain various types of data, such as text, URLs, contact information, or other forms of data. How does a QR code work? QR codes work by encoding information within the pattern of black squares and white spaces. When scanned using a smartphone camera or a QR code scanner app, the encoded data is quickly interpreted and processed, allowing the user to access the embedded information, such as a website link, contact details, or other digital content. Are shortened links safe? Bitly.cx services prioritize user safety and security, shortened links can pose risks. Users should be cautious when clicking on shortened URLs from unknown or untrusted sources. Some services offer features like link preview to help users identify the destination before clicking.

Онлайн казиноның дамуы: Онлайн казино қалай жасалады Онлайн казинолар бүкіл әлемнен мыңдаған ойыншыларды тарта отырып, интернеттегі ең танымал ойын-сауық түрлерінің біріне айналды. Бірақ көптеген адамдар онлайн казино қалай құрылғанын және оның табысты дамуы үшін не қажет екенін қызықтырады. Бұл мәтінде біз онлайн-казино әзірлеуге қатысты негізгі қадамдар мен процестерді қарастырамыз. Нарықты зерттеу. Онлайн казино құрудың бастапқы қадамы құмар ойындар нарығын мұқият зерттеу болып табылады. Ойыншыларды тартатын бірегей ұсынысты әзірлеу үшін мақсатты аудиторияны, бәсекелестерді, нарық ерекшеліктерін және трендтерді анықтау қажет. Лицензия алу. Көптеген елдерде онлайн казино жұмыс істеу үшін арнайы лицензия қажет. Казино ережелері мен талаптары әр елде әртүрлі, сондықтан жобаңыздың заңдылығы мен сенімділігін қамтамасыз ету үшін тиісті лицензия алу қажет. Платформаны таңдау. Онлайн-казиноны дамыту үшін сіз үшінші тарап әзірлеушілері ұсынған дайын платформаларды пайдалана аласыз немесе өзіңіздің бағдарламалық құралыңызды жасай аласыз. Дайын платформалар жобаны тезірек іске қосуға мүмкіндік береді, бірақ жеке бағдарламалық жасақтаманы жасау кезінде бірегей функциялар мен мүмкіндіктерді іске асыру мүмкіндігі бар. Дизайн және интерфейсті дамыту. Тартымды және интуитивті дизайн ойыншыларды тартуда және ұстап тұруда маңызды рөл атқарады. Веб-сайтты немесе мобильді қосымшаны ыңғайлы пайдалануды қамтамасыз ететін ыңғайлы интерфейсті жасау маңызды. Ойын провайдерлерінің интеграциясы. Онлайн-казинолардың басты артықшылығы – әртүрлі құмар ойындарының болуы. Ол үшін әртүрлі слоттар, покер, рулетка және басқа да ойындарды ұсынатын ойын провайдерлерін біріктіру қажет. Қауіпсіздікті қамтамасыз ету. Онлайн казинолар өз ойыншылары үшін қауіпсіздіктің жоғары деңгейін қамтамасыз етуі керек. Жеке деректерді қорғау, қауіпсіз төлем жүйелері және алаяқтықтың алдын алу – ерекше назар аударуды қажет ететін маңызды аспектілер. Төлем жүйелерін енгізу. Ыңғайлы ойын үшін ойыншыларға ақшаны салу мен алудың әртүрлі нұсқалары ұсынылуы керек. Төлем жүйелерінің интеграциясы транзакциялардың жылдам және қауіпсіз орындалуын қамтамасыз етеді. Маркетинг және жылжыту. Онлайн-казиноны іске қосқаннан кейін оны нарықта белсенді түрде жылжыту керек. Маңызды құралдарға контент маркетингі, әлеуметтік медиа, жарнамалық науқандар және серіктестік бағдарламалар кіреді. Пайдаланушыны қолдау. Сапалы тұтынушыларға қолдау көрсету казино табысының маңызды факторы болып табылады. Ойыншының сұрақтары мен мәселелеріне уақтылы жауап беру адал аудиторияны сақтауға көмектеседі. Талдау және дамыту. Онлайн казиноны дамыту – үздіксіз процесс. Статистиканы, пайдаланушылардың пікірлерін талдау және саладағы өзгерістерге жауап беру маңызды. Функционалдық пен ұсыныстарды үнемі жақсарту ойыншыларды сақтап қалуға және жаңаларын тартуға көмектеседі. Онлайн-казино құру – егжей-тегжейге назар аударуды және стратегиялық көзқарасты қажет ететін күрделі және жауапты процесс. Табысты казино айтарлықтай табыс әкеліп, көптеген ойыншылар үшін танымал ойын-сауыққа айналуы мүмкін. Казино жасалып, шығарылғаннан кейін ойыншылар Ресей нарығындағы ең жақсы онлайн казинолардың рейтингін қарап, оны сол жерден тауып, оның сапасы мен беделін бағалай алады. Бұл рейтинг жаңа казино бұрыннан барларға қарағанда қаншалықты жақсы немесе нашар екенін бағалауға мүмкіндік береді. Айта кету керек, Ресейдегі онлайн-казинолардың рейтингі үнемі жаңартылып отырады, сондықтан казинолар өз позицияларын өзгерте алады. Неліктен ресейлік онлайн казино веб-сайты жақсы жұмыс істемеуі мүмкін Ресейдегі онлайн казино сайты жақсы жұмыс істемеуі мүмкін бірнеше себептер бар. Ең көп таралғандарын қарастырайық. Ресурстарды блоктау Ресейде құмар ойындардың кейбір түрлеріне тыйым салатын заңдар бар. Билік осы ережелерді бұзатын онлайн казино сайттарына кіруді бұғаттауға құқылы. Бұл сайттың елдегі пайдаланушылар үшін қолжетімсіз болуына немесе техникалық блоктау әдістері қолданылғандықтан өнімділіктің төмендеуіне әкелуі мүмкін. Интернет провайдерлерімен проблемалар Ресейдегі кейбір интернет-провайдерлер белгілі бір сайттарға, соның ішінде онлайн казиноларға кіруді шектеуі немесе оларға қосылу жылдамдығын төмендетуі мүмкін. Бұл кешігуді, бетті жүктеу мәселелерін және сапасыз ойын тәжірибесін тудыруы мүмкін. Серверлерде жоғары жүктеме Танымал онлайн казинолар, әсіресе ең жоғары сағаттарда, жоғары ойыншы трафигіне ұшырауы мүмкін. Егер серверлер бұл жүктемені көтере алмаса, сайт баяу болуы немесе тіпті уақытша қолжетімсіз болуы мүмкін. Онлайн казинолар өз веб-сайттарын қалай оңтайландырады Онлайн-казино – бұл пайдаланушының мінсіз тәжірибесі мен тиімді жұмысын қамтамасыз ету үшін өз сайтын үнемі оңтайландыруды қажет ететін күрделі және көп қырлы кәсіпорын. Веб-сайтты оңтайландыру – бұл жаңа клиенттерді тартуға, барларын сақтауға және казино үшін тұрақты пайданы қамтамасыз етуге мүмкіндік беретін негізгі фактор. Оңтайландырудың негізгі аспектілерінің бірі веб-сайт өнімділігі болып табылады. Казино жылдам қамтамасыз етуі керек Мен беттерді жүктеймін және барлық ойын процестерінің бірқалыпты жұмыс істеуін қамтамасыз етемін. Бұған кодты оңтайландыру, сервер инфрақұрылымын жақсарту және деректерді кэштеуді пайдалану арқылы қол жеткізіледі. Бізге Mostbet веб-сайтына қосылыңыз Маңызды қадам – ​​сайтты әртүрлі құрылғыларға бейімдеу. Көптеген пайдаланушылар мобильді құрылғыларда казино ойындарын ойнайтынын ескере отырып, сайт мобильді құрылғыларға ыңғайлы және сезімтал дизайнға ие болуы керек. Бұл кез келген құрылғыда сайтпен ыңғайлы өзара әрекеттесуді қамтамасыз етеді және тұтынушылардың қанағаттануын арттырады. Қауіпсіздік онлайн казино үшін ең маңызды басымдықтардың бірі болып табылады. Веб-сайтты оңтайландыру заманауи шифрлау әдістерін енгізуді және пайдаланушы деректерін қорғауды қамтиды. Сондай-ақ казинолар осалдықтарды болдырмау және инфрақұрылымын сыртқы шабуылдардан қорғау үшін жүйелері мен бағдарламалық жасақтамасын үнемі жаңартып отыруы керек. Торап өнімділігін үздіксіз тестілеу және талдау оңтайландырудың тағы бір негізгі аспектісі болып табылады. Казино өз веб-сайтының функционалдығын жүйелі түрде тексеріп, ықтимал проблемаларды анықтап, оның функционалдығын жақсартуы керек. Пайдаланушы трафигі мен мінез-құлық деректерін талдау ең танымал ойындарды анықтауға және аудитория мүдделері үшін сайтты оңтайландыруға көмектеседі. Tekel Caddesi Kordonboyu Mah.

Wendy works across four main workstreams, with a range of clients. Strategy Quality Coaching Development Strategy With a career in leadership and management and specialism in human resources, Wendy is a non-executive director and business coach. Wendy attained the Financial Times Level 7 Diploma for Non-Executive Directors to accredit her corporate law knowledge and governance experience. Wendy holds non-executive director roles for a leadership development organisation, a private training provider, and for a coaching membership body. Wendy was recently Chair of the Governing Board for EMCC UK working collaboratively with the President and Executive Board on the strategic direction to meet the needs of the UK membership. Wendy is currently Chair of the South East Coaching Group – a regional coach membership body. Wendy drives strategic development with the Board and builds stakeholder relations to buy in to new modernised membership offer, together with strategic alliances with other organisations. The SECG is very proud of its contribution to giving back to the community through training, coaching and networking. The membership offer includes continuing professional development through events, training, networking, special interest groups and resources. Coaching Executive Coaching Wendy has been offering executive and business coaching for around 30 years and has 2500+ coaching practice hours. She works with senior directors and boards, as well as managers at all levels. Coaching tends to be mainly with individuals, although some team coaching projects have been completed. Wendy works with a wide range of coaching topics including change situations, career direction, and problem solving. Wendy enjoys using the Time to Think methodology and is a member of the Thinking Environment Collegiate to maintain competence and experience. Coaching Supervision Wendy has been offering coaching supervision for around 10 years and has 500+ supervision practice hours. She works with both individual and group supervision and focuses mainly on normative, formative and restorative techniques. Wendy is an accredited supervisor with EMCC and holds an ILM Level 7 Diploma in Coaching Supervision. Quality Wendy has a background of working with both accreditation and qualifications from a quality assurance management perspective. Wendy currently works with EMCC Global across international coaching qualifications and individual accreditation, as well as the Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development (CIPD) for HR and L&D qualifications and Chartered membership assessment (all levels). Previously Wendy worked with the Institute of Leadership & Management qualifications, the London Chamber of Commerce business qualifications, and for the Qualifications & Curriculum Authority on the development of vocational education. She specialises in advising organisations towards achieving coaching cultures as a way of working and approach to managing people. Wendy is an Investors in People Practitioner, advising and guiding organisations to develop their systems and processes by way of investing in their people, towards meeting the framework over a period time, and then maintaining and improving provision. Wendy also works with the Investors in Apprenticeships and Investors in Wellbeing frameworks. Development Wendy offers training and development across a wide range of leadership and management and human resources topics. Contracts include the following clients: We all felt we had enjoyed the course and that you had given us lots to think about! Although some of us were apprehensive when the course started we felt you created a safe and positive environment that helped us to quickly engage with the learning. Although some of us are comfortable with role play, many of us appreciated using real life situations rather than role play. We also liked that the tools were useful and for the most part not hard to understand. We appreciated the way you tailored the course, for example using Myers Briggs language that we have a shared understanding of, and giving insights to models that are useful in team/leadership roles. We all felt we had gained useful tools and approaches not just for a coaching situation but also for coffee machine conversations and for life in general. Our offices are based in Surrey although most of our work is conducted on client premises or at training venues. 07879 405898 wendy@wsacoaching.co.uk If you have any questions about our services please leave a message and we will respond as soon as possible.

Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Issue Over facebook and google in india Recently As we all know, that the supreme court of India has asked many social networking sites to remove all content which are Unexpectable by our Indian society.. many people are making fun of our social leaders,cricketers, politicians, social workers and many people this is not good in good sense. ofcourse it can be good for some peoples to take revenge and also to make fun.anyway our court has raised good point, i really appreciate our supreme court. Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3. Consider to Log Out from your account when you are leaving. If you are decided to go for an outing then dont forget to log out from facebook it will prevent from "" like jacking "" and many other such threats. Likejacking is a form of clickjacking or malicios methors that will lead to users like a website article or a website link as a status update without the intension of the user to ""like"" the thing. For an example recently users hit by a click jacking attack that read """"LOL This girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE,"" and, ""This man takes a picture of himself EVERYDAY for 8 years!!"" after clicking this link user take into a suspicious page that contain a clickjacking worm that automatically post links on the users wall. 4.

Super Million Hair is artificial hair made from vegetable fibers and cut into 0.3 to 0.5 mm pieces. Different sized and shaped fibers are mixed together to add volume and cover your hair naturally (e.g. long/short, thin/thick, and straight/bent). For people with thin hair, Super Million Hair adheres to the scalp to add thickness to the thinning area. Because Super Million Hair is applied directly on the skin, special care has been taken to assure the safety of our product. Super Million Hair has been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It has also been tested for skin allergies and declared safe by university medical experts. As previously stated, Super Million Hair is made out of vegetable fibers (rayon) extracted from pulp. It is 100% biodegradable in order to protect our natural environment. หยิบใส่ตะกร้า อ่านเพิ่มเติม SMH No.2 Dark Brown 15g 1,499.00 ฿ 0 out of 5 Super Million Hair คือผมเทียมที่ทำจากเส้นใยพืชธรรมชาติขนาด 0.3-0.5 มม เส้นใยที่มีขนาดและรูปร่างที่แตกต่างกันจะผสมกันเพื่อเพิ่มปริมาณและครอบคลุมเส้นผมของคุณตามธรรมชาติ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นผมยาวผมสั้น ผมหนาผมบางหรือแม้กระทั้งผมหยักโสก สำหรับคนที่มีผมบาง Super Million Hair จะเข้าปกปิดหนังศีรษะเพื่อเพิ่มความหนาไปยังบริเวณที่มีผมบาง เพราะ Super Million Hair จะเข้าไปปกปิดโดยตรงบนผิวเพื่อสร้างความมั่นใจในความปลอดภัย Super Million Hair ได้รับการอนุมัติโดยองค์การระหว่างประเทศเพื่อการมาตรฐาน (ISO) นอกจากนี้ยังได้รับการทดสอบสำหรับโรคภูมิแพ้ผิวหนังและได้รับการยอมรับด้านความปลอดภัยโดยผู้เชี่ยวชาญด้านการแพทย์มหาวิทยาลัย ตามที่ระบุไว้ก่อนหน้านี้Super Million Hair ทำจากเส้นใยพืช (เรยอน) ที่สกัดจากเยื่อกระดาษที่สามารถย่อยสลายได้ 100% ตามธรรมชาติ อ่านเพิ่มเติม หยิบใส่ตะกร้า SMH No.2 Dark Brown 25g 2,399.00 ฿ 0 out of 5 Super Million Hair คือผมเทียมที่ทำจากเส้นใยพืชธรรมชาติขนาด 0.3-0.5 มม เส้นใยที่มีขนาดและรูปร่างที่แตกต่างกันจะผสมกันเพื่อเพิ่มปริมาณและครอบคลุมเส้นผมของคุณตามธรรมชาติ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นผมยาวผมสั้น ผมหนาผมบางหรือแม้กระทั้งผมหยักโสก สำหรับคนที่มีผมบาง Super Million Hair จะเข้าปกปิดหนังศีรษะเพื่อเพิ่มความหนาไปยังบริเวณที่มีผมบาง เพราะ Super Million Hair จะเข้าไปปกปิดโดยตรงบนผิวเพื่อสร้างความมั่นใจในความปลอดภัย Super Million Hair ได้รับการอนุมัติโดยองค์การระหว่างประเทศเพื่อการมาตรฐาน (ISO) นอกจากนี้ยังได้รับการทดสอบสำหรับโรคภูมิแพ้ผิวหนังและได้รับการยอมรับด้านความปลอดภัยโดยผู้เชี่ยวชาญด้านการแพทย์มหาวิทยาลัย ตามที่ระบุไว้ก่อนหน้านี้Super Million Hair ทำจากเส้นใยพืช (เรยอน) ที่สกัดจากเยื่อกระดาษที่สามารถย่อยสลายได้ 100% ตามธรรมชาติ หยิบใส่ตะกร้า หยิบใส่ตะกร้า SMH No.3 Light Brown 10g 999.00 ฿ 0 out of 5 Super Million Hair คือผมเทียมที่ทําจากเส้นใยพืชธรรมชาติขนาด 0.3-0.5 มม เส้นใยที่มีขนาดและรูปร่างที่แตกต่างกันจะผสมกันเพื่อเพิ่มปริมาณและครอบคลุมเส้นผมของคุณตามธรรมชาติ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นผมยาวผมสั้น ผมหนาผมบางหรือแม้ ทั้งกระผมหยักโสก สําหรับคนที่มีผมบาง Super Million Hair จะเข้าปกปิดหนังศีรษะปกปิดเพื่อเพิ่มความหนาไปยังที่มีผมบาง เพราะ Super Million Hair จะเข้าไปโดยตรงบนผิวเพื่อสร้างความมั่นใจในความปลอดภัย Super Million Hair ได้รับการอนุมัติโดยองค์การระหว่างประเทศเพื่อการมาตรฐาน (ISO) นอกจากนี้ยังได้รับการทดสอบสําหรับโรคภูมิแพ้ผิวหนังและได้รับการยอมรับ ด้านความปลอดภัยโดยผู้เชี่ยวชาญด้านการแพทย์มหาวิทยาลัย ตามที่ระบุไว้ก่อนหน้านี้Super Million Hair ทําจากเส้นใยพืช (เรยอน) ที่สกัดจากเยื่อกระดาษที่สามารถย่อยสลายได้ 100% ตามธรรมชาติ หยิบใส่ตะกร้า visit our shop online ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ตั้งแต่เริ่มใช้ Super Million Hair ปัญหาเรื่องผมก็หมดไป ขอบคุณมาก” ชายคนหนึ่งจากฟุกุโอกะวัย 30 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ผมด้านหน้าฉันดูบางลงจนรู้สึกได้ Super Million Hairช่วยปกปิดส่วนนั้นได้อย่างเป็นธรรมชาติ และยิ่งรู้ว่าเป็นผลิตภัณฑ์จากธรรมชาติ ยิ่งทำให้มั่นใจที่จะใช้ต่อไป” ผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งจากจังหวัดนีงะตะวัย 30 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ขอบคุณสำหรับผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ยอดเยี่ยม.” ชายคนหนึ่งจากโตเกียววัย 50 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ฉันเหนื่อยกับการหาผลิตภัณฑ์เพื่อเสริมผมที่บางของฉัน จนกระทั่งมาลงตัวที่Super Million Hair ที่ทำให้ผมดูหนาขึ้นอย่างเป็นธรรมชาติมาก” ผู้หญิงจากโอซาก้าวัย 40 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ฉันใช้สินค้าประเภทเดียวกันมาหลายยี่ห้อก่อนที่จะมาพบSuper Million Hair ตอนนี้ฉันมีความสุขมากที่ได้รู้จักและใช้ผลิตภัณฑ์นี้” ผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งจากจังหวัดคานากาวัย 50 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ฉันรู้สึกแย่เมื่อเห็นผมตัวเองที่บางลงในช่วงก่อนงานแต่งงาน จนกระทั่งแม่ของฉันซื้อ Super Million Hairจากร้านทำผมมาให้ และแล้วภาพงานแต่งงานของฉันก็เป็นที่จดจำกับผมที่ดูดกหนา ขอบคุณSuper Million Hair” ชายวัย 20 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ลูกของฉันผมบางเนื่องจากโรคบางอย่างจนถูกเพื่อนที่โรงเรียนล้อ สุดท้ายเค้าก็ไม่ยอมไปโรงเรียน ฉันแนะนำให้เค้าใช้ Super Million Hair ตอนนี้ลูกของฉันสามารถกลับไปโรงเรียนได้ตามเดิม ขอบคุณSuper Million Hair” ผู้หญิงวัย 30 ปี ความคิดเห็นของลูกค้า “ผมของฉันบางมาตั้งแต่เด็ก พยายามที่จะแก้ไขหลายๆวิธีแม้กระทั่งใส่วิกผม แต่ก็ไม่สามารถทำให้ฉันพอใจได้เลย สุดท้ายก็ได้ลองSuper Million Hair ซึ่งทำให้ผมดูหนาได้อย่างเป็นธรรมชาติ มันเป็นสิ่งมีค่ากับฉันมาก” ผู้หญิงวัย 30 ปี ติดต่อเรา Line ID @smhthailand.com เบอร์โทรศัพท์ 02-0503552 ( วันจันทร์ถึงศุกร์ เวลา 9:00 -17:30) Facebook www.facebook.com/Supermillionhairthai Super Million Hair is not hair growth but adds volume in an instant.

devsite001.com,1,en,29,381,"Lee Pons Skip to main content Skip to footer Home About Albums Videos Gigs Merch Contact Home About Albums Videos Gigs Merch Contact Lee Pons | Boogie-Woogie Piano Magic Lee Pons is a dynamic boogie-woogie and blues pianist whose electrifying performances bring the soulful spirit of New Orleans to life. Blending vintage piano rhythms with modern flair, his music captures the essence of blues, rock ‘n’ roll, and timeless Southern charm. Soul. Rhythm. Mastery. Where Boogie-Woogie Meets Classical Brilliance Lee Pons isn’t your average piano man. Born with the soul of New Orleans but sharpened by the precision and discipline of Juilliard, Lee’s music blends wild Boogie-Woogie with a deep understanding of music theory and performance. His piano and bass playing capture the best of both worlds—raw, soulful energy paired with impeccable technique About Lee Lee Pons’ musical journey began in the vibrant streets of New Orleans, where the sounds of blues, jazz, and Boogie-Woogie filled the air. Growing up surrounded by music, it wasn’t long before Lee found himself glued to the piano, imitating the legendary musicians he heard all around him. But while New Orleans may have ignited his passion, it was at the Juilliard School of Music where Lee truly refined his skills. Attending Juilliard was a turning point in Lee’s life. The years spent studying classical piano gave him a deep understanding of music’s technical side. But even while learning the intricacies of Bach and Beethoven, Lee never lost his love for the New Orleans sound that first captured his heart. Juilliard added precision to his passion, giving him the tools to not only perform but to innovate and push the boundaries of Boogie-Woogie and blues. After Juilliard, Lee returned to his roots, bringing with him the knowledge and technique that only a world-class education can provide. Combining the fire of New Orleans with the discipline of Juilliard, Lee Pons has created a sound all his own—one that’s as deeply soulful as it is technically brilliant. Oh, did I mention Lee plays a mean bass too? Both upright and electric! Musical Journey Lee’s journey is a rare one—a blend of street-level authenticity and world-class training. His time at Juilliard gave him the technical foundation to elevate his Boogie-Woogie playing to new heights. He can switch between a bluesy, free-form jam and a classically structured performance with ease, a skill that makes him a standout in both the blues and classical communities. Collaborations and Bands With a résumé that includes not only performances with blues greats but also classical recitals, Lee has proven himself as a musician with incredible range. Whether playing Boogie-Woogie in a smoky bar or laying down a refined piano concerto, his versatility keeps him in demand across multiple genres. ""Lee Pons is one of those rare musicians who can make you feel the raw energy of New Orleans and then turn around and deliver the kind of technical brilliance only a Juilliard graduate could offer.""

Von MÃ¼ssen zu DÃ¼rfen Du willst aus deiner Situation ""ausbrechen""? Wir helfen dir dein Unternehmen Leben, mit Innehalten, neue Wege gehen und in deine Selbstbestimmung finden. Termin sichern Kennst du Fragen die SelbstgesprÃ¤che wie: Wenig Hoffnung Wie jetzt alles weitergehen soll? Keine Orientierung Du fÃ¼hlst du dich irgendwo im Leben falsch abgebogen? Nur noch Kapitulation Deine innere Stimme sagt: âich will nicht mehr"" Keine Luft mehr Der gefÃ¼hlte Druck, ist so groÃ, dass es du kaum noch Atmen kannst? â¦ und denkst oft nur mehr: âICH WILL RAUSâ Bitte lass dir sagen, du bist nicht alleine! So wie dir, geht es vielen anderen Menschen auch! Du wÃ¼nscht dir, es wÃ¼rde dich jemand an die Hand nehmen und dir neue Wege da heraus zeigen? Dann bist du hier EXAKT richtig: PersÃ¶nlichkeitsentwicklung Selbstliebe SpiritualitÃ¤t Gesundheit Glaube Geldthemen Motivation Freiheit 3 Schritte Erschaffe deine NEUE REALITÃT Klarheit Bekomme eine neutrale Sichtweise, wo du gerade im Leben stehst Wissen und Information Wir besprechen deine Vision und erstellen einen Plan der dich in der Richtung hÃ¤lt. Umsetzung Wenn du mÃ¶chtest, begleite ich dich gerne Schritt fÃ¼r Schritt in deine neuen Welt - zu deinem NEUEN ICH. Erstes Kennenlern-GesprÃ¤ch Klicke hier und suche dir einen Termin aus, der fÃ¼r dich passt! ErzÃ¤hle mir von deiner bzw. davon, was dich antreibt oder warum du RAUS willst. Termin sichern 20 min Video-Call (Zoom) Ãber mich Alles Ã¼ber MINDSET Meine Passion ist es, Dir mit meinem langjÃ¤hrigen Erfahrungen Ã¼ber das Leben in Freiheit zu zeigen, worauf man alles achten sollte, damit all die oft kostenintesiven Fehler mÃ¶glichst vermieden werden kÃ¶nnen und wie du in die Lage kommst, dir dein Leben so zu gestalten, dass alles in Harmonie fliesst. Jeder erste mutige Schritt fÃ¼hrt zu einem neuen Leben Zugegeben, diese Aufgabe zu lÃ¶sen zÃ¤hlt wahrscheinlich zu den schwierigsten des ganzen Lebens. An einem Punkt, an dem fÃ¼r dich vielleicht âChaos im Kopfâ herrscht, alle Dinge um dich herum âpassierenâ und es fÃ¼r dich fast nicht mehr mÃ¶glich scheint, die richtigen Entscheidungen zu treffen. Genau hier reiche ich dir die Hand, um kurz Inne zu halten und mit neuem Wissen, Struktur und Erfahrungen gestÃ¤rkter weiter voran zu schreiten. Auch wenn du das wohl stÃ¤rkste Hilfsmittel zur Hand nehmen willst, DIE UMGEBUNGSÃNDERUNG und Dauerhaft oder auch nur zeitweise in der Dominikanischen Republik leben willst, kannst du das gerne mit mir realisieren. Ich bin diesen Weg als Pionier bereits gegangen. Alles fliesst in die Zusammenarbeit ein, mit einem ZIEL: Um dich von E.R.F.O.L.G. zu ERFOLG zu begleiten. Mit neuen Prinzipien zu deiner Vision Meistere die 4 dimensionale WELT Im ERFOLG-Prinzip nehmen wir uns bewusst Zeit, um eine klare und starke Vision zu entwickeln. Diese Vision ist mehr als nur eine Ansammlung von Zielen â sie ist der Kompass, der uns in die gewÃ¼nschte Zukunft fÃ¼hrt. Sie bildet die Grundlage fÃ¼r jedes Ziel, das wir setzen, und gibt diesem eine tiefere Bedeutung. Die Vision steht Ã¼ber allem: Sie definiert, warum wir bestimmte Ziele verfolgen und wie sie in unser Ã¼bergeordnetes Lebenskonzept integriert sind. Sie hilft uns zu verstehen, dass es nicht nur darum geht, einzelne Schritte zu machen, sondern darum, diese Schritte auf einer klaren Richtung und einem Zweck auszurichten. In einem erweiterten Kontext betrachten wir die Vision im 4-dimensionalen Raum . WÃ¤hrend Ziele uns von A nach B fÃ¼hren, zeigt uns die Vision, warum dieser Weg wichtig ist und welche Bedeutung er fÃ¼r uns hat. Sie ist die Richtung zwischen dem gewÃ¼nschten Zustand (B) und unserem aktuellen Zustand (A), wobei sie nicht nur die Dimensionen des Raumes einbezieht, sondern auch die Dimension der Zeit. Die Zeit ist es, die wir fÃ¼r eine ausgerichtete Planung zu dem Wunschzustand (B) verwenden. Die Vision ist der SchlÃ¼ssel , um Ziele richtig zu setzen. Ohne Vision wÃ¼rden Ziele ihre Richtung verlieren. Sie geben den Zielen ihre Bedeutung, indem sie das âWarumâ und das âWieâ klÃ¤ren. Um die Vision zu entwickeln, ist es wichtig, sich intensiv Zeit zu nehmen und diese auszuarbeiten. Nur mit einer klaren Vision wissen wir, ob unsere Ziele tatsÃ¤chlich in Einklang mit unseren wahren Werten und dem, was wir wirklich erreichen wollen, stehen. Dazu haben wir das E.R.F.O.L.G.-Prinzip entwickelt. Ich Will Raus stellt alles auf den Kopf. Hier erfÃ¤hrst du zuerst die Geheimnisse und im Anschluss bekommst du die Hilfe zur Umsetzung. Mit meinem Buch E.R.F.O.L.G.-Prinzip jedem die MÃ¶glichkeit mit Expertenhilfe den EIGENEN WEG zu finden. Die grosse Kunst ist es, Ã¼ber ALLES (sich selbst) den Ãberblick zu behalten und richtig zu organisieren. Daher ist es BEDINGUNG VorgÃ¤nge und ZusammenhÃ¤nge VON DIR SELBST zu verstehen. Erst danach kannst Du effizient in die Umsetzung gehen. Ich selbst werde dich, wenn du das wÃ¼nscht und wir resonieren, dabei unterstÃ¼tzen, um mit dir deine LEBENSAUSRICHTUNG und Ziele auszuarbeiten und zu erreichen. FÃ¼r ein erfÃ¼lltes, glÃ¼ckliches und harmonisches Leben! Chris Ko IWR GrÃ¼nder Ehemann, Papa, VisionÃ¤r und Unternehmer Ein grossartiges Leben startet mit einem Traum Wenn du den ersten Schritt gemacht hast, beginnt sich der Traum bereits zu realisieren. JETZT Termin prÃ¼fen Harmonie und GlÃ¼ck ist planbar Wir sind hier um dir die Werkzeuge fÃ¼r ein glÃ¼ckliches und erfÃ¼lltes Leben an die Hand zu geben.

These utilities make it easier to retrieve data from the IPFS network in resource-constrained environments such as browsers and low-powered devices. # Public IPFS Gateways The IPFS Foundation provides the following public gateways: https://ipfs.io : Path resolution (opens new window) gateway https://dweb.link : Subdomain resolution (opens new window) gateway https://trustless-gateway.link : Gateway limited to trustless and verifiable responses (opens new window) These gateways block abusive content using the Bad Bits Denylist (opens new window) . To report abusive content and content breaches of the IPFS Community Code of Conduct (opens new window) , please send an email with the CIDs to abuse@ipfs.io. Technical operations are run by the Waterworks Community on behalf of the IPFS Foundation. To report any technical problems with these gateways, you can open an issue in the Waterworks Community repository (opens new window) . # Abuse Policy When a takedown request for the ipfs.io and/or dweb.link gateway(s) is first received at abuse@ipfs.io, the sender will receive an automated system receipt. Next, someone from the takedown team will vet the request to validate that it is legitimate and should be accepted. Once the validity of the request has been established, it will be submitted for further processing. From there, an internal system extracts the relevant information from the request and generates an entry for it in our takedown lists. The list is then published to our gateway nodes, and the content in question will return a 410 status when visited. Your browser may have a local cache of the content in question and might not reflect that something has been blocked on the gateways. To avoid browser caching, attempt to view the content using your browser's incognito or private mode. You can also prevent caching issues by using a command-line tool such as Curl or Wget. # Supported Features The above public gateways support the following: ipfs.io and dweb.link support the full set of IPFS Gateway specifications (opens new window) . trustless-gateway.link supports only the Trustless Gateway subset of the specification (opens new window) . They support HTTP clients reaching them over both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses The underlying IPFS nodes backing the gateways support the following mutable identifiers under the /ipns namespace: IPNS Public Keys, e.g. dweb.link/ipns/k51q.... DNSLink for all ICANN (opens new window) registered domains as well as .crypto and .eth , e.g. dweb.link/ipns/vitalik.eth The underlying IPFS nodes backing the gateways support retrieving data from peers that: Have either ipv4 or ipv6 addresses Are either reachable over the public internet or are accessible via libp2p's relay-v2 protocol and reach out to the gateway nodes via dialback Support one of the following libp2p transport configurations: QUIC-v1 TCP or WS or WSS, Yamux, TLS or Noise WebTransport Support the Bitswap protocol ( v1.2 (opens new window) , v1.1 (opens new window) or v1.0 (opens new window) ) Have either advertised their data to the Amino DHT , or have advertised to IPNI such that their data has been indexed by cid.contact (opens new window) # Other Public Gateways Additionally, there's a community-maintained tool for finding and testing public gateways (opens new window) . # Delegated Routing While IPFS Gateways are immensely helpful in doing all the heavy lifting of finding providers for CIDs and retrieving them, they can be a choke point for retrieval and a point of centralization. Delegated Routing endpoints are a key step towards eliminating the emergent centralization of public gateways thereby increasing the health of the network. Browsers and low-powered devices can make a single HTTP call to a Delegated Routing endpoint with the CID they are looking to retrieve. The endpoint returns the multiaddresses of the providers for the CID, from which the browser can download directly. # Delegated Routing Endpoint The IPFS Foundation provides a public delegated routing endpoint backed by someguy (opens new window) with the URL https://delegated-ipfs.dev/routing/v1 Under the hood, someguy handles requests by looking up the DHT and Network Indexer. This endpoint can also be useful for debugging discoverability of CIDs, for example: https://delegated-ipfs.dev/routing/v1/providers/bafybeicklkqcnlvtiscr2hzkubjwnwjinvskffn4xorqeduft3wq7vm5u4 (opens new window) will show the providers for the CID bafybeicklkqcnlvtiscr2hzkubjwnwjinvskffn4xorqeduft3wq7vm5u4 . # Amino DHT Bootstrappers For an IPFS node to join the Amino DHT, it needs to discover other peers. Bootstrap nodes assist with this process. The IPFS Foundation provides several public bootstrap nodes that are published as a TXT record to DNS at _dnsaddr.bootstrap.libp2p.io : /dnsaddr/sg1.bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmcZf59bWwK5XFi76CZX8cbJ4BhTzzA3gU1ZjYZcYW3dwt /dnsaddr/sv15.bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN /dnsaddr/am6.bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmbLHAnMoJPWSCR5Zhtx6BHJX9KiKNN6tpvbUcqanj75Nb /dnsaddr/ny5.bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmQCU2EcMqAqQPR2i9bChDtGNJchTbq5TbXJJ16u19uLTa ( Rust based (opens new window) ) Note: You can query DNS for the specific records with the following command: dig +short TXT _dnsaddr.bootstrap.libp2p.io To increase resilience and implementation diversity, as of 2024, the IPFS Foundation also provides a bootstrap node powered by js-libp2p (opens new window) at: /dnsaddr/va1.bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/12D3KooWKnDdG3iXw9eTFijk3EWSunZcFi54Zka4wmtqtt6rPxc8 . # Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) # How is the ipfs.io gateway different from other gateways? The ipfs.io gateway is a gateway run by The IPFS Foundation. Many other entities run their own gateways with different policies around throttling and access, which may be subject to other local laws and regulations. A list of public gateways is available here (opens new window) . The IPFS Foundation does not store or host the data that is viewable through the ipfs.io gateway. Rather, the ipfs.io gateway allows users to view content hosted by third parties. The IPFS Foundation does not have any control over the data that is viewed through the ipfs.io gateway, nor does the IPFS Foundation have control over other gateways. # Is the ipfs.io gateway a data storage host? No. The ipfs.io gateway is a passthrough portal to data hosted by third parties on nodes in the IPFS network. It is not a data storage host. # Can websites rely on the ipfs.io gateway for hosting? No. Websites should not rely on the ipfs.io gateway for hosting of any kind. The ipfs.io gateway is a community resource run by the IPFS Foundation to help developers build on IPFS. Users of the ipfs.io gateway must use resources sparingly. The IPFS Foundation will throttle or ban users who overuse or misuse community resources, including relying on the ipfs.io gateway for website hosting or violating the Community Code of Conduct. # How does the ipfs.io Gateway handle global data regulations? The IPFS Foundation complies with the laws and regulations of relevant jurisdictions. As explained above, the ipfs.io gateway is not a website hosting provider or data storage provider, and the IPFS Foundation cannot remove material from the Internet that is accessible through the ipfs.io gateway. # Who is responsible for the content that is viewed through the ipfs.io gateway? Users of the ipfs.io gateway are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the ipfs.io gateway. The ipfs.io gateway is not a data storage provider or website host. The ipfs.io gateway allows users to view content hosted by third parties over which the IPFS Foundation exercises no control. The fact that certain content is viewable through the ipfs.io gateway does not mean it is hosted by the ipfs.io gateway or that the IPFS Foundation can do anything to delete that content. As explained above, the ipfs.io gateway is not a website hosting provider or data storage provider, and the IPFS Foundation cannot remove material from the Internet that is accessible through the ipfs.io gateway. If you believe that material accessible through the ipfs.io gateway is illegal or violates your copyright, you are encouraged to directly notify whoever is hosting or controls that data. While the ipfs.io gateway does not serve as a host for data or websites, in appropriate circumstances, the IPFS Foundation can disable the ability to view certain content via the ipfs.io gateway. This does not mean that the data itself has been taken down from the network but rather that the content is not viewable using the ipfs.io gateway. This also will not impact the availability of the data through other gateways run by other parties. # Can the IPFS Foundation take down content viewable through the ipfs.io gateway? No. The ipfs.io gateway is one of many portals used to view content stored by third parties on the Internet. The IPFS Foundation is not hosting that content and cannot take it down, but it can block the ability of users to view that content via the ipfs.io gateway in appropriate circumstances.

crediunion1alaska.web.app,1,en,0,6,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he married or single?” “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?” “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.” “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.” “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news."

I capture the inapprehensible in those fugitive glances that merge and equal everything. About Gustavo Rojas Rojas received post-secondary training in painting at the Roberto Ruiz Rojas Cultural Center in Ibagué, Colombia. He received a BFA from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1991 and an MFA in painting from San Francisco State University in 1996. He has shown his work at the Círculo Nacional de Periodistas in Bogotá (1981), the Sala Javier Alzate Avendaño in Bogotá (1982), and the North Country Regional Juried Art Show at SUNY Potsdam, New York (1997).

Top Products products Low Power Lab ADS-B Transmitter ADSBMiNi When we do ADS-B lab tests, such as test our own developed ADS-B receivers or do some ADS-B demo, we always need an ADS-B transmitter. However, all the ADS-B transmitters on market are essentially Mode-S transponders with ADS-B OUT function. These ADS-B transponders are designed to be installed on aircrafts. So, it needs some very complicated configurations. It’s OK when you really install these ADS-B transponders on aircraft, because you already have all the wires and systems in place to support these ADS-B transponders’ operation. But it’s a challenge when you want to make these ADS-B transponders work in lab. It essentially requires recreating an aircraft's comprehensive environment to ensure these ADS-B transponders operates as they would in flight. Furthermore, these standard ADS-B transponders emit at a high power of around 250W. Such intense power levels are not only harmful to health but also pose a risk of damaging your ADS-B receivers, when persons and ADS-B receivers exposed at close range to these ADS-B transponders in lab. ADSBMiNi is a low power, simple plug&play operation, 1090MHz ADS-B transmitter specifically designed for lab test applications. Integrated with a high-quality multi-GNSS receiver, ADSBMiNi can work independently without any other external devices. ADSBMiNi can also be utilized for airport surface movement surveillance demonstrations by putting it on a car (please refer to our Airport Vehicle ADS-B Transmitter ADSBVT for professional airport vehicle surveillance applications). Additionally, ADSBMiNi can be deployed on a drone for drone surveillance demonstrations (please also refer to our Portable ADS-B Transmitter ADSBPGA , designed for ADS-B transmitters used on general aviation aircrafts or UAV/drones). products Portable ADS-B Ground Receiver ADSB-RE1090 ADSB-RE1090 is a high-performance, portable and user-friendly 1090MHz ADS-B ground receiver.

Recent Articles Our Latest Blog Posts blog Simple Explanation of What is ADS-B ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) is a system or technique used in aviation that relies on airborne GPS and other equipment to determine an aircraft's position and other related information. This data is then broadcasted via onboard communication equipment to ground receivers and other nearby aircrafts. In essence, ADS-B allows aircrafts to ""announce"" their position and other details, enabling ground stations and nearby aircrafts to monitor and track their movements, or to say, “see” the aircrafts. Why do we need ADS-B? What equipment are included in ADS-B? Why is it called ADS-B? What information is included in ADS-B? blog What are ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN are two fundamental concepts in ADS-B technology. The first thing we need to understand is that both ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN refer to specific functions that aircraft can have. Just like how a person speaks to communicate their whereabouts and intentions, ADS-B OUT can indeed be likened to the ""mouth"" of the aircraft, constantly “speaking” (broadcasting) its own vital information to other aircrafts and ground stations. ADS-B OUT function allow the aircraft to “be seen”. Just like how a person uses his/her ears to listen and gather information from his/her surroundings, ADS-B IN functions as the ""ears"" of the aircraft, continuously “listening to” (receiving) the ADS-B information broadcasted by nearby aircrafts. ADS-B IN function allows the aircraft to “see”. blog ADS-B Data Link As introduced in the Simple Explanation of What is ADS-B , ADS-B relies on communication equipment to transmit the aircraft's own ADS-B information to other aircrafts and ground stations. This communication link is known as the ADS-B data link. There're three tyeps of data link that ADS-B utilize, 1090ESï¼Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and VDL M4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three ADS-B data links? Which datalink should ADS-B use? blog ADS-B Standards While the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sets global standards and recommendations for aviation, including ADS-B, the practical implementation and compliance with ADS-B standards often rely on industry-specific organizations such as the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) in the United States, EUROCAE (The European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) and EUROCONTROL in Europe. Such as, DO-242, DO-260, DO-282, ED-102, ED-129, Asterix Cat021, TSO-C166, AMC20-24. blog Do all aircraft have ADS-B To answer this question, let's first understand what are ADS-B OUT and ADS-B IN . Then we come back to this question, do all aircraft have ADS-B? To address this question effectively, let's categorize ""aircraft"" into three distinct types: Air carrier aircrafts General aviation aircrafts UAV/drones blog The difference between Radar and ADS-B Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) are both types of radar systems used in aviation for aircraft detection and tracking. While both radar and ADS-B are used for aircraft surveillance, they operate on different principles and provide different levels of information.

Ready to become a successful crypto investor? Fill out a simple form and start now! Complete Registration By signing up, I consent to and acknowledge the Website's terms of use and Privacy Policy . Automated trading and investing with SmartBitBoost Ultra – a new trend in the crypto industry Crypto exchanges and various wallets are gradually becoming obsolete, giving way to something much more practical—a technology that until recently seemed amazing and fantastical. You’ve probably guessed it; we’re talking about SmartBitBoost Ultra—a new revolution in the field of investments and automated trading. This platform not only allows investing in established and emerging promising cryptocurrencies but also enables automatic trading with artificial intelligence, providing a high level of efficiency and ease of managing your assets. You are probably interested in how all this works. In simple terms, our artificial intelligence was specifically designed and fine-tuned to work with cryptocurrencies. It analyzes all fluctuations in the crypto market, taking into account various informational events, and carefully predicts the rise or fall in prices of any given crypto. Thanks to this analysis, users can profit from price differences, which is particularly important in the context of trading. As for direct investments, with the help of SmartBitBoost Ultra’s artificial intelligence, you can completely delegate the management of the crypto purchasing process. How to Begin Using SmartBitBoost Ultra? It’s quite simple. First, you need to apply for an account creation. To do this, fill out the form available at the top of the website. Second, prepare the funds necessary for purchasing crypto using AI. The minimum deposit amount required to activate your account is 250 $ . Why this amount? It is necessary for the AI to function properly, enabling it to purchase the right assets at the right time. If the deposit amount is lower, the volume of operations will be too small, significantly reducing their efficiency. Why Crypto is Your Best Investment Choice In the world of investment, there are numerous options: gold, stocks, futures, bonds. However, crypto stands out because of its high volatility, which, in skilled hands, can yield incredible returns. With SmartBitBoost Ultra, returns can reach up to 460 percent per month, and that’s not even the limit. You can always enable the reinvestment feature to reinvest your earnings, significantly increasing your monthly profitability to an average of 1100% from the initial deposit. As for asset diversity, our artificial intelligence works with more than 3000 different cryptocurrencies, ranging from well-known ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to various meme coins. It’s worth noting that the latter often turn out to be one of the most profitable ways to earn, as little-known coins can bring in thousands of percent in profit. Our AI decides what and when to buy, adding a coin to the list of potential investments at the development stage when the first mentions appear and then making a purchase when it is fully confident in the coin’s growth. Get started with SmartBitBoost Ultra How does the SmartBitBoost Ultra AI know how to act correctly? You’ve probably heard buzzwords like algorithms and machine learning. These aren’t just empty terms. To ensure our AI reached an accuracy of around 95%, we began its training long before the platform’s release. This AI has undergone numerous successful tests, learning from real examples and memorizing various behavioral patterns. In other words, we traded many cryptocurrencies in real time, experiencing both successful and unsuccessful moments. The main goal was to show the algorithms how to act correctly in different situations, not only to avoid losses but also to earn profits. The very first version of the AI contained over 100,000 different simulated situations, and now this number has exceeded 1,000,000. Thus, our SmartBitBoost Ultra AI knows how to act correctly based on a vast amount of data and scenarios, allowing it to make the most effective decisions in the highly volatile crypto market. In addition, the SmartBitBoost Ultra system includes several key features that contribute to its high accuracy and efficiency: – Market behavior analysis: The system continuously monitors and analyzes the actions of other market participants to better understand current trends and sentiments. – Adjustments based on external information: The AI makes changes to its strategy based on data obtained from external sources, provided they are deemed reliable. This allows the system to quickly adapt to new conditions. – Adaptation to market conditions: The system can modify its actions depending on the situation in the crypto market to minimize risks and maximize profits. All these factors ensure the stated accuracy and functionality of SmartBitBoost Ultra. No experience with cryptocurrencies? No problem, use SmartBitBoost Ultra ! We often fear jumping into the unknown, which is understandable, as it initially always brings some discomfort. The same goes for cryptocurrencies; understanding how it works requires a lot of effort, energy, and an incredible amount of motivation. Signals, long, short, Pump and Dump, ICO, HODL, and dozens of other confusing terms are now in the past, because the era of artificial intelligence has arrived. We can rightfully call ourselves revolutionaries in this field, as such functionality did not exist before our market entry. This platform is your golden ticket to a wealthy and easy life. With SmartBitBoost Ultra, you no longer have to delve into the complexities of trading and crypto investments, as the system will do everything for you. This represents the future you can already touch and utilize to generate a stable passive income. All you need to do is create an account, deposit at least 250 $ , and start the process. You can either invest in crypto for the long term or trade using AI simultaneously. Ideally, a larger budget is recommended in this case, as the initial amount will be proportionally divided. Nevertheless, everything you earn from trading can either be saved or reinvested. How you proceed is up to you. By default, the amount will not be reinvested, so you need to remember this and configure the system according to your preferences. Starting the AI is simple – just log in and click the start button, which becomes available immediately after activating your account. SmartBitBoost Ultra is a platform you can trust! Nowadays, the internet is filled with numerous platforms that promise you the world without any real foundation. In the case of SmartBitBoost Ultra, we can confidently attest to its effectiveness in real-world conditions. The platform has undergone numerous audits by independent companies, has over 5,000 active users, and the total turnover of all funds exceeds 3 billion dollars. We have earned the trust of our users with a reliable service that not only generates income but also serves as a valuable partner for storing your crypto assets.

Dit geldt zeker voor sales professionals. Een happy sales beschikt over een open mind, ziet opportuniteiten en maakt de klant of prospect nieuwsgierig door zijn aanstekelijk enthousiasme. Het eerste contact is hierbij doorslaggevend. You only have one chance to make a good first impression. Interesse? Ken uzelf oftewel uw saleszelf Wise in Sales helpt sales professionals een happy sales te worden en te blijven. Dit gebeurt via een gedifferentieerde sales coaching, waarbij ze een beter inzicht krijgen in zichzelf. Ken uzelf, de oude Grieken in Delphi wisten het al. Een greep uit de vragen voor het zelfonderzoek van elke verkoper: Welk salestype ben ik? Wat zijn mijn sterktes? Welke valkuilen heb ik? Hoe kom ik over bij de klant? Wat zorgt ervoor dat ik me goed voel in mijn sales job? Ken uw klant Cruciaal is het uitbouwen van een uitstekende relatie met de klant of prospect. Dit is een sine qua non. De klant tegemoet komen, op dezelfde golflengte komen van uw prospect, daar staat of valt alles mee. Enkele aspecten uit het coachingstraject: Hoe leer ik mijn klant of prospect kennen? Hoe leer ik mijn klant optimaal begrijpen? Hoe analyseer ik zijn vraag of probleem? Hoe formuleer ik het best een oplossing voor zijn probleem? Hoe maak ik mijn klant happy, zodat hij ambassadeur wordt van mijn product of dienst?

Ä°Ã§inde 2017 yÄ±lÄ± Nisan ayÄ±nda yaptÄ±ÄÄ±mÄ±z Ã§aÄrÄ±nÄ±n ardÄ±ndan katÄ±lÄ±mcÄ±larÄ±mÄ±zdan yavaÅ yavaÅ toplayÄ±p biriktirdiÄimiz 56 tane madde bulunuyor. Hem iÃ§eriÄi ve kurgusu hem de tasarÄ±mÄ±, eksikliÄini hissettiÄimiz ve mimarlÄ±k tarihi Ã¼zerine yazma ve okuma alÄ±ÅkanlÄ±klarÄ±mÄ±zÄ± gÃ¶zden geÃ§irmeye teÅvik edeceÄini umduÄumuz deneysel ve deneyimsel bir yaklaÅÄ±mÄ±n Ã¼rÃ¼nÃ¼. âDizimâ sÃ¶zcÃ¼ÄÃ¼nÃ¼n bÃ¶yle bir yaklaÅÄ±mÄ± temsil ettiÄini dÃ¼ÅÃ¼nÃ¼yoruz. TDK sÃ¶zlÃ¼ÄÃ¼ne gÃ¶re âdizimâ, âdizilme iÅi, dizmeâ ve âfiÅlerin, kartlarÄ±n, vb. bilgi gereÃ§lerinin belli bir kural gereÄince sÄ±ralanmalarÄ±ndan oluÅan bÃ¼tÃ¼nâ anlamlarÄ±na geliyor. 2 Bu iki anlamÄ±n birleÅiminden esinlenerek derlediÄimiz Dizimâin Ã§ok yazarlÄ±, Ã§ok maddeli bir kitap olmasÄ±, mimarlÄ±k tarihini yazarken Ã§oÄulluÄun Ã¶nemini vurguluyor. Maddeleri yazarlar tarafÄ±ndan belirlenen, aynÄ± maddenin ya da benzer maddelerin birden Ã§ok yazar tarafÄ±ndan farklÄ± yorumlarla tanÄ±mlanmasÄ± olanaÄÄ±nÄ± sunan bÃ¶yle bir Ã§oÄulluk, Dizimâin iÃ§eriÄine geniÅ ve derin bir kapsam kazandÄ±rÄ±yor. AynÄ± zamanda bu iÃ§eriÄin, âhesaplÄ± bir dÃ¼zen ve seÃ§icilik yerineâ, 3 Ã¶nceden kestirilemezliÄin belirlediÄi bir sÃ¼reÃ§te biÃ§imlenmesini saÄlÄ±yor. Ä°Ã§erik bÃ¶ylece geliÅirken tekil, Ã§izgisel, kesintisiz, sabit ve bitmiÅ bir kurgu yerine, maddelerin birbirlerine pek Ã§ok Åekilde eklemlenebildikleri ya da âyapÄ±ÅtÄ±rma iÅlemiâ 4 ile baÄlanabildikleri Ã§oklu, katmanlÄ±, kesintili, deÄiÅken ve bitmemiÅ bir yapÄ±da karÅÄ±lÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ± buluyor. Bu Ã¶zellikleriyle Dizimâin, sevgili hocamÄ±z Prof. Dr. Ä°nci AslanoÄluânun ilgi ve Ã§alÄ±Åma alanlarÄ±nÄ±, mimarlÄ±k tarihine yaptÄ±ÄÄ± katkÄ±larÄ± yansÄ±tan bir Ã§eÅitlilik ve zenginlik taÅÄ±dÄ±ÄÄ±na inanÄ±yoruz. Dizim, antik Ã§aÄdan gÃ¼nÃ¼mÃ¼ze uzanarak tiyatrolarÄ±, tapÄ±naklarÄ±, kiliseleri ve camileri, kÃ¼lliyeleri, kÃ¼mbetleri, mÃ¼zeleri, evleri ve mÃ¼ze-evleri, konutlarÄ± ve mahalleleri, eÄitim yapÄ±larÄ±nÄ±, kervansaraylarÄ±, hamamlarÄ±, otelleri, iÅ hanlarÄ±nÄ±, ofis binalarÄ±nÄ±, fabrikalarÄ± kapsarken kÃ¶Åe kuleleri, atriumlar, salonlar ve mobilyalar gibi birimlere odaklanÄ±yor. Bu farklÄ± Ã¶lÃ§eklere kent Ã¶lÃ§eÄini de katarak kentlerin Ã§eperlerine, surlarÄ±na, katmanlarÄ±na, yÃ¼zlerine, yangÄ±nlarÄ±na, bulvarlarÄ±na, plajlarÄ±na doÄru geniÅliyor; tÃ¼m bu Ã¶lÃ§ekleri iÃ§erecek Åekilde korumacÄ±lÄ±k kuramlarÄ±nÄ± ve uygulamalarÄ±nÄ± tartÄ±ÅÄ±yor; bu tartÄ±ÅmayÄ± anÄ±t kavramÄ±yla mimarlÄ±ÄÄ±n yazÄ± hÃ¢llerine taÅÄ±yor. Bunu yaparken de, mimarlÄ±ÄÄ±n diline, anlatÄ±sÄ±na, belgeliÄine ve kitaplarÄ±na, fotoÄraflarÄ±na ve kartpostallarÄ±na, gÃ¶rsel sanatlarla, mÃ¼zikle, maddi kÃ¼ltÃ¼rle, toplumsal cinsiyetle ve coÄrafyayla iliÅkilerine bakÄ±yor; tasarÄ±m, yapÄ±m ve kullanÄ±m sÃ¼reÃ§lerini iÃ§eriyor; bir yandan malzemeyle, bezemeyle, inÅaat tekniÄiyle ilgilenirken diÄer yandan da tasarÄ±mcÄ±, uygulayÄ±cÄ±, iÅveren, kullanÄ±cÄ± olarak bireyin ya da devletin rolÃ¼ne uzanÄ±yor. TÃ¼m bu Ã§eÅitliliÄi ve zenginliÄi iÃ§inde okuyucularÄ±mÄ±za bir baÅvuru kaynaÄÄ± olarak sunduÄumuz Dizim, bizi sadece yeni kuramsal Ã§erÃ§evelerle, Åimdiye kadar ihmal edilmiÅ Ã¶rneklerle, farklÄ± ve gÃ¼ncel deÄerlendirmelerle tanÄ±ÅtÄ±rmÄ±yor. Bir taraftan karÅÄ±laÅtÄ±rmalar yapmamÄ±zÄ± ve aralardaki boÅluklarÄ± tespit etmemizi saÄlÄ±yor, bir taraftan da mimarlÄ±k tarihini nasÄ±l yazdÄ±ÄÄ±mÄ±za dair kendimize eleÅtirel bir gÃ¶zle bakmamÄ±zÄ± saÄlÄ±yor. Gelecekte belli aralarla eklemeye devam etmeyi amaÃ§ladÄ±ÄÄ±mÄ±z yeni maddelerin Dizimâin iÃ§eriÄini daha da kapsamlÄ± kÄ±lacaÄÄ±nÄ± ve aynÄ± zamanda mimarlÄ±k tarihi yazÄ±mÄ± tartÄ±ÅmalarÄ±nÄ± daha da canlandÄ±racaÄÄ±nÄ± umuyoruz. 5 Dizimâi bir kitap olarak deÄil de, bir kutu-kitap olarak derleme fikrini de TDK sÃ¶zlÃ¼ÄÃ¼ndeki tanÄ±mÄ±ndan esinlenerek geliÅtirdik. Bu tanÄ±mÄ±n karÅÄ±lÄ±k geldiÄi Ã¼rÃ¼nÃ¼ elle yapÄ±lan bir faaliyetin ortaya koyduÄunu dÃ¼ÅÃ¼nerek, Dizimâin de benzer bir Åekilde Ã¼retilebilmesini, iÃ§indeki maddelerin ayrÄ± ayrÄ± nesneler olarak elle dizilebilmesini, yerlerinin farklÄ± kurallara gÃ¶re deÄiÅtirilebilmesini hayal etmeye baÅladÄ±k. BÃ¶ylece, Levent ÅentÃ¼rkâÃ¼n deyiÅiyle, âmatbu nesne olarak kitabÄ±n aÅÄ±rÄ± belirlenmiÅliÄiâni aÅmaya Ã§alÄ±Åan, 6 dizimi okuyucusundan okuyucusuna deÄiÅen bir kitap tasarlamanÄ±n imkÃ¢nÄ±nÄ± araÅtÄ±rmaya baÅladÄ±k. Kitap yaratma sÃ¼recine okuyucularÄ±mÄ±zÄ± da katmanÄ±n peÅine dÃ¼ÅmÃ¼Åken karÅÄ±mÄ±za Ã§Ä±kan baÅka seÃ§enekler arasÄ±ndan, bir nesne olarak kutunun iÃ§erdiÄi ya da ima ettiÄi muhafaza etmek, saklamak, biriktirmek, istiflemek gibi fiillerin AslanoÄluânun notlarÄ±nÄ±, Ã§izimlerini, slaytlarÄ±nÄ±, fotoÄraflarÄ±nÄ±, kartpostallarÄ±nÄ± arÅivleme alÄ±ÅkanlÄ±ÄÄ±yla Ã¶rtÃ¼ÅtÃ¼ÄÃ¼nÃ¼ fark ettiÄimizde de, bir kutu-kitapta karar kÄ±ldÄ±k. Tabii bir de, iÃ§inde ne olduÄunu merak ederek kutuyu aÃ§manÄ±n ve aÃ§tÄ±ktan sonra iÃ§indekileri karÄ±ÅtÄ±rmaya, teker teker Ã§Ä±karÄ±p bakmaya, dokunmaya, evirip Ã§evirmeye baÅlamanÄ±n heyecanÄ±nÄ± kitap deneyimine katmak istedik. OkuyucularÄ±mÄ±z bu kutu-kitabÄ± ellerine alÄ±p kapaÄÄ±nÄ± aÃ§tÄ±ktan sonra iÃ§inde, Roland BarthesâÄ± hatÄ±rlayarak, alfabetik dÃ¼zenin âyansÄ±zlÄ±ÄÄ±â ile dizilmiÅ maddeleri gÃ¶recekler. 7 Biz bÃ¶yle dizdik ama biliyoruz ki, bu ilk tanÄ±Åma anÄ±ndan itibaren her kutu-kitap okuyucusuna gÃ¶re Åekillenmeye baÅlayacak, zaman iÃ§inde yeniden Åekillenecek ve âiÃ§indekilerâ sayfasÄ± her okuyucu tarafÄ±ndan tekrar yazÄ±lacak. Maddeler yazarlarÄ±na ya da iÃ§eriklerine gÃ¶re sÄ±ralanacaklar; bina tiplerine, yerlere, dÃ¶nemlere ya da kavramlara gÃ¶re sÄ±nÄ±flandÄ±rÄ±lacaklar; belki de her okuyucunun kiÅisel tercihine gÃ¶re ilginÃ§ olandan ilginÃ§ olmayana doÄru dÃ¼zenlenecekler. BazÄ±larÄ± da kutu-kitabÄ±n dÄ±ÅÄ±nda kendilerine yer bulacaklar, baÅka kitaplarÄ±n arasÄ±na karÄ±Åacaklar. Bu arada belki kutu-kitap da okuyucularÄ±n iÃ§ine koyduklarÄ± notlarla, fotoÄraflarla, Ã§izimlerle, baÅka baÅka nesnelerle kendi baÅÄ±na bir âkutu-arÅivâe ya da bir ânadire kutusuâna dÃ¶nÃ¼Åecek. BÃ¶yle bir iÃ§erikle, kurguyla ve tasarÄ±mla derlediÄimiz Ä°nci AslanoÄlu iÃ§in Bir MimarlÄ±k Tarihi Dizimiâni ilk aÅamalarÄ±ndan itibaren destekleyen ODTÃ MimarlÄ±k FakÃ¼ltesi DekanÄ± Prof. Dr. GÃ¼ven A.

Dizim ile ilgili heyecanÄ±mÄ±zÄ± paylaÅarak tasarÄ±m sÃ¼recini baÅlatan Selda BancÄ±âya mÃ¼teÅekkiriz. Fikirlerimizi, hayallerimizi sevgili hocamÄ±zÄ±n en sevdiÄi renklerin, mavinin ve beyazÄ±n eÅliÄinde bir kutu-kitap tasarÄ±mÄ±yla gerÃ§ekleÅtiren Ãzlem ÃlÃ§erâe Ã§ok ayrÄ± bir teÅekkÃ¼r borÃ§luyuz. TÃ¼m katÄ±lÄ±mcÄ±larÄ±mÄ±za ise Ã§aÄrÄ±mÄ±za cevap vererek bizi yalnÄ±z bÄ±rakmadÄ±klarÄ± iÃ§in minnettarÄ±z. OnlarÄ±n deÄerli katkÄ±larÄ±yla okuyucularÄ±mÄ±za sunduÄumuz bu MimarlÄ±k Tarihi Dizimiâni sevgili hocamÄ±zÄ±n anÄ±sÄ±na ithaf ediyoruz. T.

Daha sonra eÄitimine Ä°stanbul Teknik Ãniversitesiânde, Restorasyon ve MimarlÄ±k Tarihi alanÄ±nda devam etti ve Prof. Dr. DoÄan KubanâÄ±n danÄ±ÅmanlÄ±ÄÄ±nda âErken Cumhuriyet DÃ¶nemi MimarlÄ±ÄÄ± (1923-1938)â baÅlÄ±klÄ± tezi ile 1979 yÄ±lÄ±nda doktora derecesini aldÄ±. Prof. Dr. AslanoÄlu, 1963 yÄ±lÄ±nda Orta DoÄu Teknik Ãniversitesi MimarlÄ±k BÃ¶lÃ¼mÃ¼ânde baÅladÄ±ÄÄ± akademik kariyerini 2002 yÄ±lÄ±nda emekli olana kadar aynÄ± bÃ¶lÃ¼mde sÃ¼rdÃ¼rdÃ¼.

BÃ¶ylece TÃ¼rkiyeâde, Ä°TÃ ve Mimar Sinan GÃ¼zel Sanatlar Ãniversitesiândeki programlardan sonra, MimarlÄ±k Tarihi YÃ¼ksek Lisans ve Doktora derecesi veren Ã¼Ã§Ã¼ncÃ¼ programÄ±n ve bu alanda Ä°stanbul dÄ±ÅÄ±nda aÃ§Ä±lan ilk programÄ±n geliÅmesinde Ã¶nemli rol oynadÄ±.

AslanoÄlu, eÄitimciliÄine koÅut bir Åekilde akademik Ã§alÄ±ÅmalarÄ±nÄ± geliÅtirirken Ã¶zellikle on dokuzuncu ve yirminci yÃ¼zyÄ±l mimarlÄ±klarÄ±na dair Ã§ok sayÄ±da makalenin yanÄ± sÄ±ra, Tireâde Camiler ve ÃÃ§ Mescit, Ankara Karacabey KÃ¼lliyesi ve Erken Cumhuriyet DÃ¶nemi MimarlÄ±ÄÄ± (1923-1938) baÅlÄ±klÄ± Ã¼Ã§ kitap yayÄ±nladÄ±. Ä°lk iki kitabÄ±nÄ±n Ã§ekirdeÄini akademik hayatÄ±nÄ±n baÅlarÄ±nda yazdÄ±ÄÄ± iki makalesi oluÅtururken, Ã¼Ã§Ã¼ncÃ¼ kitabÄ±nÄ± doktora tezine dayandÄ±rarak hazÄ±rladÄ±. Hepsinin paylaÅtÄ±ÄÄ± Ã¶zellikler ise, AslanoÄlu ile Ã¶zdeÅleÅen mimarlÄ±k tarihi yazÄ±mÄ±nÄ±n en temel bileÅenleriydi: Konu hakkÄ±nda kapsamlÄ± arÅiv ve saha araÅtÄ±rmasÄ± yapmak, araÅtÄ±rma bulgularÄ±nÄ± Ã§izimler ve fotoÄraflarla desteklemek ve bu Åekilde Ã¼retilen bilgiyi katalog halinde sunmak. Bu bileÅenlerin en zengin halleriyle kendilerini gÃ¶sterdikleri Erken Cumhuriyet DÃ¶nemi MimarlÄ±ÄÄ± (1923-1938), AslanoÄluânun tezini araÅtÄ±rdÄ±ÄÄ± ve yazdÄ±ÄÄ± 1970âli yÄ±llara kadar mimarlÄ±k tarihi yazÄ±mÄ±nÄ±n pek ilgilenmediÄi bir dÃ¶neme dair Ã¶ncÃ¼ Ã§alÄ±Åmalar arasÄ±nda yerini aldÄ±. AslanoÄlu kitabÄ±nda sadece Ankara ve Ä°stanbul gibi bÃ¼yÃ¼k kentlerdeki deÄil, pek Ã§ok kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k Anadolu kentindeki mimarlÄ±k Ã¼retimini de inceledi. Benzer Åekilde, sadece anÄ±tsal yapÄ±lara odaklanmakla yetinmedi, onlarÄ±n dÄ±ÅÄ±nda kalan ve birÃ§oÄu hakkÄ±nda yeterli bilgi bulunmayan diÄer kamusal mimarlÄ±k Ã¼rÃ¼nlerini ve konutlarÄ± da Ã§alÄ±ÅmasÄ±na dÃ¢hil etti. BÃ¶ylece, kapsamlÄ±, detaylÄ± ve sistematik bir Åekilde dÃ¶nemin mimarlÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ±n yazÄ±lÄ± ve gÃ¶rsel belgelemesini yapan kitabÄ± bir arÅive dÃ¶nÃ¼ÅtÃ¼. Zaman iÃ§inde kitapta basÄ±lan fotoÄraflar, Ã§alÄ±ÅmanÄ±n tamamlandÄ±ÄÄ± dÃ¶nemin de belgeleri hÃ¢lini aldÄ±lar ve bugÃ¼n Ã§oÄu yÄ±kÄ±lmÄ±Å ya da deÄiÅmiÅ olan dÃ¶nem yapÄ±larÄ±nÄ±n yeni Ã§alÄ±Åmalardaki kaynaklarÄ± oldular. FotoÄraflarÄ±n 1970âleri belgelemesine benzer Åekilde, kitap da, erken Cumhuriyet dÃ¶nemi mimarlÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ± hem anÄ±tsallÄ±kla sÄ±nÄ±rlamayarak, hem merkez-Ã§eper iliÅkileri Ã§erÃ§evesinde deÄerlendirerek, hem de dÃ¶nemin politik, ideolojik, ekonomik, toplumsal ve kÃ¼ltÃ¼rel baÄlamÄ± Ã¼zerinden yorumlayarak 1970âlerin temsil ettiÄi tarih yazÄ±mÄ± yaklaÅÄ±mlarÄ±nÄ± bugÃ¼ne taÅÄ±dÄ±. AslanoÄluânun yine kitapta yer verdiÄi TÃ¼rkiye ve BatÄ± mimarlÄ±klarÄ±nÄ±n karÅÄ±laÅtÄ±rmalÄ± analizi, aÃ§tÄ±ÄÄ± bazÄ± seÃ§meli derslerin ve yÃ¼rÃ¼ttÃ¼ÄÃ¼ tezlerin konusu oldu. KitabÄ±nÄ±n iÃ§erdiÄi konulardan bazÄ±larÄ±nÄ± daha sonraki Ã§alÄ±ÅmalarÄ±nda tekrar ele aldÄ±, Ã¶rneÄin TÃ¼rkiyeâde Ã§alÄ±Åan yabancÄ± mimarlarÄ±n iÅlerine odaklanan makaleleri de bu alandaki Ã¶ncÃ¼ araÅtÄ±rmalar arasÄ±nda yer aldÄ±. EmekliliÄine hazÄ±rlandÄ±ÄÄ± yÄ±llarda ise, kitabÄ±nÄ±n erken Cumhuriyet dÃ¶nemi perspektifini biraz daha geniÅletmeyi ve gÃ¼ncellemeyi hedeflediÄi Ä°ngilizce bir kitap projesi Ã¼zerinde Ã§alÄ±Åmaya T. Elvan Altanâla baÅladÄ±. Paul RicoeurâÃ¼n 1961 yÄ±lÄ±nda yazdÄ±ÄÄ± âUniversal Civilization and National Culturesâ (âEvrensel UygarlÄ±k ve Ulusal KÃ¼ltÃ¼râ) baÅlÄ±klÄ± makalesinden yola Ã§Ä±karak âThe Concepts of âNationalismâ and âInternationalismâ in Architecture: First National Architectural Movement, c. 1908-1930â (MimarlÄ±kta âUlusalcÄ±lÄ±kâ ve âUuslararasÄ±cÄ±lÄ±kâ: Birinci Milli Mimari AkÄ±mÄ±, 1908-1939â) baÅlÄ±ÄÄ±yla ve el yazÄ±sÄ±yla ilk notlarÄ±nÄ± tuttuÄu bu projenin tamamlanmasÄ±nÄ± ardÄ±nda bir miras olarak bÄ±raktÄ±. Erken Cumhuriyet DÃ¶nemi MimarlÄ±ÄÄ± (1923-1938), sunduÄu bilgi ve belgelerle, konu hakkÄ±nda daha sonra gerÃ§ekleÅtirilen akademik Ã§alÄ±ÅmalarÄ±n temel kaynaÄÄ±na dÃ¶nÃ¼ÅÃ¼rken, Mimarlar OdasÄ± Ankara Åubesiânin 2000âlerin baÅÄ±nda baÅlayan âBina Kimlikleriâ projesinin de Ã§Ä±kÄ±Å noktasÄ±nÄ± oluÅturdu. Proje ekibinin akademik danÄ±ÅmanlÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ± yapan AslanoÄluânun kitabÄ±nda yer alan bina tanÄ±tÄ±m metinleri, proje kapsamÄ±nda hazÄ±rlanan sergide ve katalogda da kullanÄ±ldÄ±. KitabÄ±n fotoÄraflarÄ± ise baÅlÄ± baÅÄ±na ayrÄ± bir serginin, ODTÃ MimarlÄ±k Tarihi LisansÃ¼stÃ¼ ProgramÄ± tarafÄ±ndan Ekim 2010âda dÃ¼zenlenen I.

This requires an evaluation of your entire operation to answer some key questions. Learn More Design/Engineering Services By coordinating the design and engineering of a new food and beverage facility, CMC achieves the greatest levels of efficiency and effectiveness with every project. Learn More Construction Services The members of CMC management and staff have an average of 20 years experience in the integrated architectural, engineering and construction format. Learn More Our Mission CMC’s Mission is to foster mutually beneficial and long-term relationships with our clients, employees, and vendors by delivering comprehensive and innovative services focused on our client’s success. About Us Client Testimonials “Kettle Cuisine evaluated several firms before selecting CMC to design and build our new, state-of-the-art, BRC compliant, soup processing facility. We chose CMC based upon their track record of successful on time and on budget completion of USDA inspected, food processing facilities. After building many food processing facilities in the US and Europe, I am proud to say this is the best project in which I have been involved. As important as the end result, I am also pleased to count the folks at CMC as friends on whom I can rely.” Nigel McGinn, VP Operations “One of the best decisions we made going with you guys. Professional all the way through even after the job was completed. Bill still keeps in touch!” JB Gillette, President “Since the early 2000’s, CMC and Blount Fine Foods have enjoyed a fantastic relationship. Team CMC comes to the table with a creative, open mind. They are quick to react to the often changing program requirements of our food processing projects. They bring great value to our company and they bring it with a smile. We look forward to our next project with them!” Todd Blount, President “Over the past few years, it seems as though CMC has become part of Cumberland Farms. The multiple projects we have executed together have dramatically improved the way Cumberland Farms does business, saving us millions of dollars along the way. Their knowledge, versatility and flexibility have been invaluable to us.” Ari Haseotes, CEO “Over the past decade plus, CMC has become an invaluable partner for Maines. In addition to designing and building our foodservice distribution facilities across the country, they are integral to our long range planning and our enhancement of efficiency at existing facilities. Their in-depth knowledge of foodservice operations results in facilities that are truly best in class. We look forward to another decade plus of successful partnering with CMC!” Terry Walsh, Executive Vice President & CEO “CMC has designed and built several Ready-to-Eat, food processing projects for Greencore. All were executed on extremely aggressive schedules within operating, USDA inspected, BRC facilities. The CMC team has consistently gone above and beyond the call to exceed our high expectations. Time and time again we go back to CMC to solve our toughest problems and they always come through for us.” Richard McGowan, Director Strategic Initiatives “CMC helped us evaluate multiple options for our expansion. We looked at various greenfield options as well as expanding at our existing facility. In the end, CMC came up with a great, creative solution for an expansion of our existing facility on our very tight, downtown city lot. And they executed on that tight lot without interrupting our business. They are great people to deal with!” Bill Catauro, Jr. , President “How do you describe the CMC team? Smart, experienced, knowledgeable, responsive, honest, creative, committed to quality; the White Knights of design and construction in the food and beverage industry!” John Kinnealey, President “Building a modern, efficient, multi-temp warehouse facility was considerably easier than building a new home with far fewer surprises or headaches. It was painless enough that I asked CMC back to do it again several years later doubling our warehouse capacity. I guess that says it all. CMC is a well-managed and responsive turn-key design/build company with engaged management that doesn’t disappear when the job is done. They cultivate relationships and I prefer that approach.” Joe Cara Donna, Vice President “CMC’s first project with Martin Brower was a time critical, 100,000 SF freezer, cooler and refrigerated dock expansion in St. John, MI. The project had to be completed by calendar year end. Despite site acquisition delays that pushed the start of the project to mid-July and unsuitable soil delays that halted work for several weeks, they completed the project early and significantly under budget. Quite an accomplishment! I can’t imagine any firm performing any better.” Mark J. Grittner, VP Operations Support, NA “When Pate Dawson evaluated firms to design and build our new Statesville, NC foodservice distribution facility, we were very impressed by the CMC presentation. Little did we know, that was just the start. They proceeded to analyze our operation and redesign our original plan to save us over $1 million and give us a much better masterplan. During the execution of the project, they continued to provide value by following up on every subcontractor and inspecting all work completed in intricate detail. Our experience with CMC is one we will look forward to repeating with our next expansion!” Mac Sullivan, CEO One Adams Place, Suite 300 859 Willard Street Quincy, MA 02169 Phone: (888) 328-2962 Fax: (617) 328-1779 Boston Minneapolis Atlanta About Us Portfolio Our Services News Contact"

Executive Coaching is an efficient, high-impact process that helps high-performing people in leadership roles improve results in ways that are sustained over time. Soft skill Training One of the recent survey of India today states that “Young India lacks soft skills”. The importance of soft skills is often undervalued and less training is provided on it in educational institutions. Having identified this gap which challenges the students we would like to offer different courses which would help to bridge this gap and equip them with necessary people skills to become an empowered individual. Leadership Training ""Leadership is a function of knowing yourself, having a vision that is well communicated, building trust among colleagues, and taking effective action to realize your own leadership potential.""

With the three motto: HOLINESS, FAITH AND LOVE, it has been in front line, preaching about sanctification and holy living as a prerequisite for the kingdom of God.

Um segundo de distração é o suficiente para que você entre com seu carro na traseira de outro veículo. Preciso de proteção agora! No Brasil, ocorrem 72 acidentes de trânsito por hora Reportagem do SBT News , mostra que foram registrados 632.764 acidentes de trânsito em 2021. O equivalente a 72 incidentes por hora no Brasil. As informações são do Registro Nacional de Acidentes e Estatísticas de Trânsito ( RENAEST ), da Secretaria Nacional de Trânsito. Em 2021, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina e São Paulo concentraram o maior número de acidentes e mortes do país. Em Minas, foram 176.181 acidentes. No estado da região Sul do país foram 125.675 incidentes. Já em São Paulo, foram 119.637 acidentes. Só nesses estados, foram registrados 421.493 acidentes. Agora pare para pensar. E se isso acontece e, por azar, você acaba acertando um desses carros importados caríssimos ? O conserto vai ficar uma fortuna, não é mesmo? Bom, se você tiver uma proteção auto com cobertura para terceiros não precisará se preocupar com isso. Basta acioná-lo e comunicar o sinistro, assumindo a culpa. Então, todos os reparos necessários serão feitos pela empresa de proteção veicular . A melhor parte é que a cobertura para terceiros não possui franquia , você só precisará pagá-la se tiver que reparar algo no seu carro. Outro grande problema para motoristas brasileiros Independentemente da região em que você more, estará certamente exposto à violência diariamente. E isso inclui roubos e furtos. De 2019 e 2021 o Brasil teve ao menos 1.032.731 veículos levados por criminosos . Isso significa que a cada 1 minuto, dois veículos são roubados no Brasil. Por dia, são 2829 e por hora, 117. Em 2022, mesmo com muitos Estados ainda não tendo divulgado os números, já foram registrados mais de 51 mil roubos e furtos de veículos ( levantamento HelloSafe Brasil ). Você não vai querer perder um veículo que acabou de comprar, não é mesmo? Se ele tiver sido financiado, ainda pior, pois você precisará pagá-lo por muitos outros meses. Já pensou ter a dívida e não ter o carro? Ou seja, se o seu veículo for roubado, seu financiamento não será quitado . Você continuará devendo as parcelas, a menos que você tenha um plano de proteção do carro. Se possuir um plano de proteção, a empresa de proteção veicular pagará a dívida em aberto . Mesmo quando o veículo tem anos de uso, você não vai querer perdê-lo, pois o prejuízo seria grande. Especialmente se você tiver que comprar um novo.

Es fácil dejarse llevar por la emoción del juego y apostar más de lo que se puede permitir. Al fijar límites de gasto, se evita caer en la tentación de seguir jugando cuando las cosas no van bien. Otro consejo clave es elegir juegos que se conozcan bien. Antes de empezar a jugar, es recomendable familiarizarse con las reglas y estrategias de cada juego. Esto aumenta las posibilidades de éxito y reduce el riesgo de cometer errores costosos. Además, es importante aprovechar las promociones y bonos que ofrecen los pin up casino en línea. Estas ofertas pueden proporcionar ventajas adicionales, como giros gratis o dinero extra para jugar. Sin embargo, es fundamental leer detenidamente los términos y condiciones para asegurarse de cumplir con los requisitos de apuesta. Por último, se aconseja jugar de forma responsable y mantener la calma en todo momento. El juego en línea debe ser una actividad divertida y emocionante, no una fuente de estrés o ansiedad. Mantener la cabeza fría y tomar decisiones racionales son claves para disfrutar de una experiencia positiva en el casino en línea. Conoce las reglas del juego Para poder disfrutar al máximo de la experiencia de un casino, es fundamental conocer las reglas del juego. Cada juego tiene sus propias reglas y estrategias, por lo que es importante familiarizarse con ellas antes de comenzar a apostar. Antes de sentarte en una mesa de juego o comenzar a jugar en una máquina tragamonedas, tómate el tiempo de leer las reglas del juego. Muchos casinos ofrecen folletos informativos o incluso tutoriales en línea para ayudarte a entender cómo funciona cada juego. Recuerda que la clave para tener éxito en un casino no solo radica en la suerte, sino también en el conocimiento y la comprensión de las reglas del juego. ¡Así que no dudes en estudiar y practicar antes de apostar tu dinero! Aprovecha los bonos disponibles Los bonos disponibles en los casinos en línea son una excelente manera de maximizar tu experiencia de juego y aumentar tus posibilidades de ganar. Estos bonos pueden incluir dinero gratis para jugar, giros gratis en las tragamonedas, o incluso reembolsos en tus pérdidas. Para aprovechar al máximo los bonos disponibles, es importante leer y comprender los términos y condiciones de cada oferta. Esto te ayudará a saber cuánto dinero necesitas apostar antes de poder retirar tus ganancias, así como cualquier otro requisito que debas cumplir. Además, te recomendamos buscar bonos con requisitos de apuesta bajos, ya que esto significa que tendrás que apostar menos dinero antes de poder retirar tus ganancias. También es importante tener en cuenta la vigencia de los bonos, ya que algunos pueden caducar si no se utilizan dentro de un cierto período de tiempo. Recuerda que los bonos disponibles en los casinos en línea pueden variar ampliamente, por lo que te recomendamos comparar diferentes ofertas antes de decidirte por una. Algunos casinos también ofrecen bonos especiales para jugadores leales, por lo que vale la pena investigar las opciones disponibles. En resumen, aprovechar los bonos disponibles en los casinos en línea puede ser una excelente manera de aumentar tus posibilidades de ganar y disfrutar al máximo de tu experiencia de juego. ¡No dudes en aprovechar estas ofertas y mejorar tu experiencia de juego hoy mismo! Establece un límite de gasto Establecer un límite de gasto es crucial para disfrutar de una experiencia segura y responsable en el casino . Al definir cuánto estás dispuesto a gastar de antemano, puedes evitar caer en la tentación de apostar más de lo que puedes permitirte perder. Calcula tu presupuesto mensual y decide cuánto estás dispuesto a destinar al juego. Establece un límite diario o semanal para controlar tus gastos de forma más efectiva. No te excedas de tu límite establecido, incluso si estás tentado a continuar jugando en busca de una victoria. Recuerda que el juego debe ser una actividad recreativa y divertida, no una fuente de estrés o preocupación. Al fijar un límite de gasto y ceñirte a él, puedes disfrutar de la emoción del casino de manera responsable y sin poner en riesgo tu bienestar financiero. Consulta con regularidad tu saldo y tus gastos para mantener un control detallado de tu actividad en el casino . Si sientes que estás perdiendo el control o que el juego está afectando negativamente tu vida, busca ayuda profesional de inmediato. Elige juegos con altas probabilidades Al momento de elegir un juego en el casino, es importante considerar las probabilidades de ganar que ofrece cada opción. Optar por juegos con altas probabilidades aumentará tus posibilidades de obtener ganancias. Algunos de los juegos con altas probabilidades en el casino incluyen el blackjack, el póker y la ruleta europea. Estos juegos suelen tener reglas más favorables para el jugador, lo que se traduce en mayores probabilidades de ganar. Recuerda que, aunque elegir juegos con altas probabilidades puede aumentar tus chances de ganar, el factor suerte siempre juega un papel importante en los juegos de azar. Por lo tanto, es fundamental establecer un presupuesto y jugar de manera responsable en todo momento. Practica la gestión del bankroll La gestión del bankroll es una de las habilidades más importantes que un jugador de casino puede tener. Se trata de administrar de manera eficiente el dinero que se destina al juego, para evitar caer en la tentación de gastar más de lo que se puede permitir. Para practicar la gestión del bankroll de forma efectiva, es fundamental establecer un presupuesto claro y realista. Esto significa determinar cuánto dinero se está dispuesto a gastar en el casino sin afectar las finanzas personales, y ceñirse a ese límite en todo momento. Otro aspecto importante de la gestión del bankroll es fijar límites de apuesta. Es recomendable apostar solo una pequeña fracción del bankroll en cada partida, para prolongar la sesión de juego y aumentar las posibilidades de obtener ganancias a largo plazo. Además, es fundamental tener en cuenta la volatilidad de los juegos de casino. Algunos juegos ofrecen mayores probabilidades de ganar, pero también implican un mayor riesgo de pérdida. Por ello, es importante elegir juegos que se adapten al bankroll y al nivel de riesgo que se está dispuesto a asumir. En resumen, practicar la gestión del bankroll es esencial para disfrutar de una experiencia de juego segura y responsable en el casino. Al establecer un presupuesto realista, fijar límites de apuesta y elegir juegos adecuados, los jugadores pueden maximizar sus posibilidades de ganar y minimizar el riesgo de pérdida.

أي بي تي في (IPTV) أو تلفزيون الأي بي أو تلفزيون بروتوكول الإنترنت هو نظام قائم على توفير خدمة بت تلفزيوني رقمية باستخدام بروتوكول الإنترنت (IP) عبر شبكات الكمبيوتر، والتي كثيراً ما تعمل باستخدام خطوط انترنت نطاق عريض (broadband) ويشكل عام فإن الفرق الأساسي بين نظام أي بي تي في ونظم التلفزيون التقليدية هو استخدام شبكات الحاسوب بدل طرق البت التقليدية لإيصال المادة المرئية للمشاهد ما هو اشتراك TERA 4K ؟ هو اشتراك يضم مجموعة من القنوات الفضائية العالمية والعربية المشفرة والغير مشفرة في اشتراك واحد بالإضافة الى مكتبة أفلام ومسلسلات محدثة بشكل مستمر ويختلف عن نظام القنوات الفضائية العادي، بأن القنوات هنا تأتي عبر سيرفرات الانترنت وليس عبر الأقمار الصناعية، وهذا يعني انك بحاجة الى سرعة انترنت جيدة حتى تعمل القنوات بشكل ممتاز. ماهي سرعة الانترنت المناسبة لتشغيل الخدمة ؟ لكي تحظي بخدمة مميزة بدون تقطيع يجب ألا تقل سرعة الإنترنت لديك عن 4 ميجا بت بالثانية ، بعض القنوات لدينا تعمل أيضاً مع سرعة إنترنت 2 ميجا بت بالثانية. هل يمكنني الحصول على فترة تجربة ؟ نعم يمكنك تجربة الخدمة قبل الإشتراك للتأكد من جودة الخدمة ومدي ملائمتها لأجهزتك وسرعة إتصالك بالإنترنت. هل الاشتراك التجريبي يختلف عن المدفوع ؟ لا يوجد اختلاف ابدأ. الاشتراك التجريبي نفس الاشتراك المدفوع 100%، فلا يوجد اختلاف الا في مدة الاشتراك، لأن مصدر القنوات واحد من نفس السيرفر، فإذا وجدت الاشتراك التجريبي لديك سيء ستكون نفس النتيجة في المدفوع، وان وجدته ممتاز وثابت ولا يوجد مشاكل في البت والقنوات، فسيكون كذلك ان شاء الله في الاشتراك المدفوع. كيف سأتمكن من تشغيل الخدمة ؟ سيقدم طاقم الدعم الفني لدينا كافة الإرشادات والتعليمات الخاصة بتشغيل الملف وسيتابع معك حتي تتمكن من تشغيل الملف بكل سهولة ويسر. هل يمكنني وضع الإشتراك في أكثر من جهاز ؟ بالطبع نعم يمكنك تشغيل اشتراك IPTV سوا على أكثر من جهاز ولكن لا يمكنك المشاهدة الا من خلال جهاز واحد فقط (أي لا يمكنك المشاهدة على أكثر من جهاز في نفس الوقت) وهذا لحماية اشتراكك. هل يمكنني تشغيل الإشتراك في أي دولة بالعالم ؟ بكل تأكيد يمكنك تشغيل الخدمة بأي دولة في العالم لأن خدمتنا هي خدمة دولية لا تعتمد علي مكان تواجدك أو حتي جهازك ، يمكنك تشغيلها أينما كنت إذا كان متوفر لديك إنترنت ما هي طرق الدفع المتوفرة لديكم ؟ يتوفر لدينا طرق دفع سهلة من خلال الدفع الالكتروني دفع امن عن طريق المتجر ببطاقة مدى او بطاقة ائتمانية فيزا وماستركارد و Apple Pay و STC Pay و UPAY و سداد كيف هي جودة الخدمة لديكم ؟ نحن نسعى دائما لنكون الأفضل، ونحاول تجاوز كل العقبات والصعوبات لتقديم أفضل خدمة يمكننا تقديمها، لكن بالمقابل يجب أن تعلم أن قنوات الانترنت ليست كالقنوات العادية الفضائية، فهنا يوجد تحديثات كثيرة ومتغيرات كثيرة، لذلك من الطبيعي تجد ضعف في بعض القنوات في بعض الاحيان، ثم يتم اصلاحها أو حذفها او اضافة قنوات جديدة وهكذا... فلا يوجد لدينا ولا عند غيرنا جودة خدمة 100%، لكن المنافسة في من لديه أعلى نسبة من الجودة. هل محتوى الاشتراك مناسب لافراد العائلة ؟ جميع المحتوى مناسب لافراد العائلة و نسعى جاهدا لان يكون اشتراكنا يقدم محتوى خالي من المحتوى الخادش و يسعدنا تنبيهكم لنا في حالة توفرها لازالتها ماهي تطبيقات المشغله للاشتراك ؟ App Store Smarters Player Lite لاستخدام الاشتراك على جهاز الايفون والايباد يمكنك استخدام تطبيق سمارترز فهو تطبيق مشغل مشهور وسلسل بالاستخدام ويقدم لك محتوى الاشتراك بتنسيق سهل ومتناسق جدا تنزيل تنزيل Apple TV Smarters Player Lite لاستخدام الاشتراك على جهاز الابل تي في يمكنك استخدام تطبيق سمارترز فهو تطبيق مشغل مشهور وسلسل بالاستخدام ويقدم لك محتوى الاشتراك بتنسيق سهل ومتناسق جدا تنزيل تنزيل Computer | Laptop IPTV Smarters Pro لاستخدام الاشتراك لاجهزة الكمبيوتر الويندوز او الماك يمكنك تشغيله عن طريق المتصفح بشكل مباشر عن طريق هذا الموقع المباشر وادخال معلومات اشتراكك وبدء الاستمتاع باشتراكك . تنزيل تنزيل Mi Box Downloader أ دخل الرقم في برنامج داونلودر ( 210571 ) تطبيق داونلودر هو تطبيق شهير لتحميل اي تطبيق من خارج متجر قوقل بلاي في حال عدم توفره بها و طريقة عمله بسيط جدا اذ انه لكل تطبيق كود رقم معين عليك الحصول عليه و تضعه بالتطبيق و سيقوم التطبيق بتحويلك لصفحه التحميل للتطبيق و تحميله بشكل مباشر و تثبيته بجهازك . تنزيل تنزيل Android TERA 4K Pro يمكنك تحميل التطبيق الخاص باشتراكنا عن طريق الرابط المباشر من هنا او تحميله الى فلاش ميموري وتوصليه بالجهاز المراد تثبيت التطبيق به والتثبيت عن طريقه . تنزيل تنزيل FireTV stick Amazon Downloader أدخل الرقم في برنامج داونلودر ( 210571 ) تطبيق داونلودر هو تطبيق شهير لتحميل اي تطبيق من خارج متجر قوقل بلاي في حال عدم توفره بها و طريقة عمله بسيط جدا اذ انه لكل تطبيق كود رقم معين عليك الحصول عليه وتضعه بالتطبيق وسيقوم التطبيق بتحويلك لصفحه التحميل للتطبيق وتحميله بشكل مباشر وتثبيته بجهازك . تنزيل تنزيل Smartes TV IPTV Smarters Pro بخصوص شاشات ال جي و سامسونج متاجر التطبيقات بهذه المنصات لاتدعم توفر تطبيقات مشغلة مجانية فجميع الحلول المتوفرة هي مدفوعة فافضل التطبيقات التي ننصح بها هي: IBO PLAYER - BOB PLAYER - IPTV SMARTERS و جميع هذه التطبيقات مدفوعة و غير مجانية و سعرها لا يشمل سعر الاشتراك الخاصة بنا . مميزات سيرفرنا لماذا عليك اختيار سيرفر تيرا؟ جودة عالية جدا بدون تقطيع يدعم كل الأجهزة سهل التنصيب سعر مناسب عملاء راضون ضمان كامل خدمات الدعم أسعار الموزعين هل تود البدء في العمل الحر وصنع الالاف الدولارات نظام الموزعين لدي تيرا يساعدك في ذلك مع أقوي منصة ترفيهية نظرة سريعة للطلب التواصل لوحة موزع 100 نقطة ..

Hier dreht sich alles rund um euer Zwergerl. Schwangerschaft und die Baby- und Kleinkindzeit ist die schönste, aber auch wohl die anstrengendste Zeit für alle Beteiligten. Ich begleite euch gerne in all diesen Phasen, teile mit euch euer größtes Glück und stehe euch bei, wenn es mal schwerer wird. Stöbert gerne auf meiner Seite und lasst es mich wissen, wenn ich euch helfen kann! Das bin ich: Lisa Kraupner Lisa Kraupner Hallo, ich bin Lisa, komme aus dem schönen Städtedreieck, bin glücklich verheiratet und habe einen wundervollen Sohn. Ich bin Fach-Gesundheits- und Krankenpflegerin, Gesundheitsökonomin und Honorardonzentin. So kam ich zu Zwergerlzeit: Durch meine klinische Arbeit und durch meinen Sohn habe ich festgestellt, wie gerne ich doch mit kleinen Babys arbeite und wie wichtig es doch ist, Eltern in der Zeit rund um die Geburt, aber auch in schwierigen Situationen, individuell und bedürfnisorientiert begleiten und beraten zu können. Deshalb habe ich mich in vielen Bereichen weitergebildet und darf euch mit viel Wissen rund ums Thema Schwangerschaft, Geburt, Wochenbett, Babyschlaf, Babymassage und Babys mit Regulationsstörungen (sog. Schreibabys) beraten. Ich nehme mir für euch Zeit und freue mich auf euch! Neuer Eintrag Vorname: Nachname: * E-Mail: Ihr Eintrag: * Eintragen Abbrechen Das sagt man über mich: 5 Einträge Ins Gästebuch eintragen Christian 15.02.2025 10:27:03 Wir hatten eine schwere Zeit, unsere Tochter musste immer und ständig durch einen Elternteil betreut werden. Tags als auch Nachts, ansonsten viel Geschrei. 🥵 Das hatte nicht gewollte, zum Teil äußerst negative Auswirkungen auf die ganze Familie. Wir wussten selbst nicht wirklich weiter. Nur durch Lisas Ideen und Umstellungen führen wir wieder ein zufriedenes Familienleben mit den jeweiligen Freiräumen sowie der notwendigen Nähe zueinander innerhalb unserer Familie.🫶 Nur Dank dir Lisa, und deinen herausragenden Fähigkeiten ist dies aus unserer Sicht gelungen Ein herzliches Dankeschön, weiter so. Wir sind dir sehr dankbar und werden dich auf jeden Fall weitere👋 S. P. 26.07.2024 11:31:28 Zwergerltreff - Von Anfang an gut informiert! Es hat heute wieder super viel Spaß gemacht. Ein ganz riesen großes Dankeschön, dass du diesen tollen Rahmen und diese Möglichkeiten schaffst. ❤️ Ich kann es einfach nur jedem empfehlen! Christina Walter 06.06.2024 21:40:52 Mein Sohn und ich waren zum Babymassagekurs bei Lisa und können diesen nur empfehlen. Sehr angenehme, entspannte Stimmung, sehr hilfreiche Massagen von Entspannung bis hin zum Pups lösen. Wir beide haben den Kurs sehr genossen. Lisa erklärt jeden Handgriff detailliert,so dass man sich als Mama sofort sicher fühlt, dass man nichts falsch macht und auch entspannt. Birgit L. 06.06.2024 07:16:24 Wir waren am Ende all unserer Kräfte… ständiges Schreien unsers 4 Monate alten Babys… als Paar selbst haben wir uns völlig verloren, wir waren nur noch im Überlebensmodus. Dann haben wir uns an die Koki Schwandorf gewendet und bereits am nächsten Tag kam unser rettender Engel, die liebe Lisa, zu uns. Ganz vorsichtig und empathisch konnte sie von Minute eins an unser Vertrauen gewinnen. Sie hat uns aufgezeigt, dass alles was wir empfinden normal ist, dass es anderen auch so geht. Ich habe sofort geweint, literweise Tränen, ich hatte das Gefühl, ich darf das. Alleine dadurch ging’s mir besser. Lisa hat uns dann klitzekleine Dinge, Feinzeichen, wie sie es liebevoll nennt, gezeigt. Wie wir sie deuten können, was wir dann probieren könnten, wenn unser Baby dass macht und aufzeigt und es wurde sofort besser. Wir konnten es kaum glauben… ohne Hokuspokus und schreien lassen, sondern einfach in dem sie uns gezeigt hat, wie wir unser Baby „lesen“ können, denn wir haben in unserer Verzweiflung vieles einfach gar nicht mehr wahrgenommen. Und wir wurden von Woche zu Woche entspannter und dann kam uns plötzlich alles ganz logisch vor, wir wussten selber nicht, warum wir so einfach Dinge nicht deuten konnten, aber wir waren einfach zu sehr mit überleben beschäftigt. Dank Lisa können wir es kehrt einfach genießen. Sie war unser rettender Engel ♥️ Kim B. 06.06.2024 07:03:23 ich kann es immernoch nicht glauben, dass und vorallem wie ich unserer kleinen das Leben geschenkt hab🥹 Untenrum tut mir alles weh😅 aber der Rest meines Körpers ist geheilt bis in die letzte Zelle🥰 Kann nur 1000 Mal danke sagen, für die Begleitung meiner Schwangerschaft und Geburtsreise😘 Ich würde jedes weitere Kind nur noch mit dir als Doula auf die Welt bringen. Ohne deine fürsorgliche Begleitung von Anfang an bis übers Wochenbett hinaus hätten wir mit Sicherheit keine so schöne Zeit gehabt. Du warst zu jederzeit für uns erreichbar und hast mit den richtigen, lieben Worten und deinen magischen Händen jegliche Probleme gelöst ♥️ Zögern Sie nicht, mich bei Fragen zu kontaktieren ! info@zwergerlzeit.com Impressum"

Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Issue Over facebook and google in india Recently As we all know, that the supreme court of India has asked many social networking sites to remove all content which are Unexpectable by our Indian society.. many people are making fun of our social leaders,cricketers, politicians, social workers and many people this is not good in good sense. ofcourse it can be good for some peoples to take revenge and also to make fun.anyway our court has raised good point, i really appreciate our supreme court. Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Have a look at screenshots below for step by step guide. That’s it! This is the New Year gift from the Facebook to the Indian users. Note:-This service is currently available on Airtel, Aircel and Tata Docomo (India) & XLcom, Telkomsel (Indonesia). Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Simple 4 things to be secure your facebook account in 2012 In the last year December 7th the facebook founder Mark zuckerberg private photos were leaked to other photo sharing site later facebook identfied that the flaw was by a recent code change and the flaw lived only short limted time. its afecter many users including zukenberg ""Hackers are using more sophisticated methords and spammers sre for emails. Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3. Consider to Log Out from your account when you are leaving. If you are decided to go for an outing then dont forget to log out from facebook it will prevent from "" like jacking "" and many other such threats. Likejacking is a form of clickjacking or malicios methors that will lead to users like a website article or a website link as a status update without the intension of the user to ""like"" the thing.

除了制作豆奶的短视频，还有一些展示了豆奶的各种用途。有些人将豆奶用作早餐的一部分，搭配谷物和水果，既美味又健康。还有人将豆奶用作调制饮品，加入冰块、蜂蜜和巧克力粉，制作出口感丰富的豆奶冰沙。这些视频不仅展示了豆奶的多样化用途，还给人们带来了美食灵感。 除了制作和用途，豆奶的营养成分也成为了一些抖音短视频的重点。这些视频介绍了豆奶中丰富的蛋白质、植物纤维和微量元素，以及它对身体的好处。通过这些视频，人们可以更全面了解豆奶的营养成分，进一步增加对它的认识和喜爱。 豆奶短视频的流行，不仅仅是因为它能满足人们对健康生活的追求，还有抖音平台本身的特点所带来的影响。抖音以其简短、有趣、创意的短视频形式迅速吸引了大量用户，而豆奶作为一个适合制作短视频的食品，自然也受到了抖音用户的喜爱。 总的来说，豆奶在抖音短视频中的表现可谓是丰富多样。从制作豆奶的过程，到豆奶的用途和营养成分，再到豆奶在抖音平台上的流行度，都展现出了豆奶的魅力。无论是喜欢制作食物的人，还是关注健康的人，都可以通过抖音上的豆奶短视频得到自己想要的信息和灵感。所以，如果你还没有尝试过豆奶，不妨在抖音上搜索一下相关短视频，或许会对你产生一些新的观念和想法。 admin 91成人网

丝瓜视频是一款广受欢迎的短视频软件，让用户能够观看和分享各种搞笑、娱乐和创意视频。但是，丝瓜视频也因其涉及不适合青少年观看的内容而备受争议，尤其是污秽色情内容。 丝瓜视频污app安卓版的出现带来了更多选择和便利，但也引发了许多担忧。污秽内容给青少年的身心健康带来了危害，而丝瓜视频污app安卓版是否正确使用则成为了一个极为重要的话题。 首先，丝瓜视频污app安卓版的合法性值得关注。根据相关法律法规，在中国境内制作、传播和观看黄色、淫秽、猥亵和尺度过大的内容都是违法的。因此，我们强烈呼吁用户不要下载和使用丝瓜视频污app安卓版，以免触犯法律。 其次，即使丝瓜视频污app安卓版本合法，但仍需谨慎使用。不适合青少年的内容对他们的身心健康可能产生长期的负面影响。青少年正处于性格塑造和身体发育的关键时期，暴露于污秽色情内容可能导致他们对性的早熟和扭曲的认知，影响他们的价值观和行为准则。 此外，丝瓜视频污app安卓版也存在用户信息泄露和网络安全风险。一些恶意软件和黑客可能利用这些污秽app携带的病毒和木马，窃取用户的个人信息和敏感数据。因此，用户在下载和使用这类app时务必要保持警惕，选择官方认证的渠道，不轻易泄露个人信息。 面对违法风险和不良影响，政府和相关部门也应加强监管和打击力度。要禁止和打击传播淫秽、猥亵和尺度过大的内容，加强网络审查和过滤机制，维护良好的网络环境和公序良俗。 同时，家长和学校也应对青少年的网络使用进行引导和监护。家长应对孩子的网络行为进行监督，要教育他们正确使用互联网和保护个人隐私。学校应加强对青少年的性教育，提供针对性的课程和资源，帮助他们正确认识和处理性问题。 总的来说，丝瓜视频污app安卓版的存在给我们提出了一些值得思考的问题。作为社会成员，我们应该共同努力，追求一个健康、积极的网络环境。只有保护青少年的身心健康，才能培养出健康、阳光的未来一代。 admin 91成人网 可以免费观看的软件丝瓜影视app破解版看污（实时热点) 在手机应用市场上，有一款名为丝瓜影视的热门应用。该应用提供了大量的影视资源，包括电影、电视剧、综艺节目等，深受用户的喜爱。然而，对于一些用户而言，他们更希望能够观看一些更加充满刺激的内容，这就需要用到丝瓜影视app破解版。 什么是丝瓜影视app破解版呢？简单来说，它是对原始版本进行了修改，使得用户可以观看一些无法在正版应用上获得的内容。这些内容往往包括一些限制级的电影或者电视剧，以及一些色情内容。对于一些用户来说，这正是他们所期望的，因此他们会选择下载丝瓜影视app破解版。 然而，我们需要明确的是，破解版软件的使用是违法的。正版软件是由开发者经过授权和付费开发的，而破解版则是通过破解手段绕过了付费和授权机制，这违反了软件的法律条款。因此，我们强烈不建议用户使用丝瓜影视app破解版或其他任何破解软件。 使用破解版软件不仅违法，而且存在诸多风险。首先，破解版软件可能被嵌入恶意代码，这会带来安全隐患。您的个人信息可能会被窃取，账号可能会被操控，甚至会导致您的手机被病毒感染。这些都会对您的隐私和财产安全造成严重威胁。 其次，破解版软件没有官方的技术支持和更新保障。正版软件通常会定期进行更新，以修复漏洞和提升用户体验。而破解版则无法得到同样的维护和保障，可能会存在各种问题，比如视频无法播放、页面无法加载等等。这会给用户带来不必要的麻烦和困扰。 最重要的是，使用破解版软件违反了软件的使用规定，也是对开发者劳动成果的不尊重。软件开发需要付出大量的时间和精力，开发者应当得到相应的回报。如果所有用户都使用破解版软件，那么很多优质的软件产品可能会停止开发，对整个软件行业造成不可估量的损失。 因此，我们鼓励用户尊重版权和知识产权，支持正版软件。正版软件不仅可以获得更好的使用体验，还可以支持开发者的持续创新和发展。如果您对丝瓜影视app提供的内容有任何疑问或建议，可以直接联系开发者反馈，他们会积极对待您的意见和需求。 总之，丝瓜影视app破解版只会给您带来麻烦和风险，我们强烈不建议使用。请尊重法律和软件开发者的劳动成果，选择正版软件并合法使用。只有这样，我们才能共同营造一个良好的软件环境，让大家获得更好的观影体验。 admin 91成人网 内地免费合集分享一下91香蕉污app在线下载（已更新)

Bug Reporting using Jira With Jira, I ensure that every discovered issue is documented, tracked, and communicated effectively. My precise reporting ensures development teams have all the information they need to swiftly rectify any issues, making the software more robust. BDD using Gherkin Syntax Behavior-Driven Development is at the core of creating software that truly meets user needs. By using Gherkin Syntax, I ensure clear and concise test scenarios that reflect genuine user stories, ensuring the software is built right from the ground up. Control Versioning using Git Keeping track of changes, collaborating seamlessly with development teams, and ensuring the integrity of the codebase is crucial.

Documentario Lixeira de Hulene O incidente na lixeira do Hulene foi provocado pela chuva intensa que caiu durante a madrugada desta segunda-feira (19.02) na cidade de Maputo. O lixo acumulado no local desabou sobre residências, onde muitas famílias pernoitavam. Durante a tarde, o Serviço Nacional de Salvação Pública prosseguia com as buscas e admitia a possibilidade de serem encontradas mais vítimas debaixo dos escombros. “Pela informação que recolhemos das autoridades locais, o número de pessoas que habitavam naquelas residências supera o número dos óbitos registados. Então os trabalhos continuam com vista a verificar se realmente existem outros casos de óbitos ou não”, afirmou o porta-voz, Leonildo Pelembe. Várias famílias que residem nas proximidades do local abandonaram as suas casas, devido ao risco de acontecer outro desabamento, uma vez que no terreno são visíveis rachas no lixo acumulado.

There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life resumes. Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can remember them when it is all over. Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the motorcar. Other things that are different at the moment will be queues to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to show how far apart we should be.

Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on or off. The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles, with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.

Through the NHR program, participating governments have utilized the funding to provide over 10 million payments to renters facing eviction. Research has shown that this assistance has particularly benefited low-income renters and renters of color. Alongside other initiatives by the Administration, the ERA program has played a significant role in preventing millions of evictions since the start of the pandemic. If you have been affected by the economic challenges brought about by the pandemic, including rising living expenses and inflation, The National Housing Relief offers you an opportunity to receive support through the federal Disaster Relief Bonus. Applying for this assistance is easy and can be done online from the comfort of your own home, eliminating the need to visit any physical location due to the recent outbreak.

www.melanciadesign.com.br,1,pt,25,435,"Melancia Design - Douglas Faria Skip to content melancia design portfólio agradecimentos contato Menu melancia design portfólio agradecimentos contato Facebook Instagram O Bonsai e a Melancia Design Árvores pequenas, porém maduras. Um bonsai, que significa “plantado em uma bandeja”, tem suas raízes e galhos podados, com o objetivo de tentar obter uma forma específica, mas não previsível. Tal como meu trabalho e minha vida, que foram tomando rumos diferentes dos que eu sempre planejei. Sempre fui “rigidamente persistente” e, com o tempo, entendi que eu preciso ser flexível para não quebrar o bonsai, percebendo que decisões podem ser tomadas à medida em que novos ramos vão surgindo. Aprendi a aceitar que, quando algo foge dos meus planos, não necessariamente significa que houve uma falha, mas sim, novos brotos indicando um outro rumo a seguir. Por isso, a Melancia Design se amolda ao meu tempo, com a dimensão necessária para que esteja sempre bem cuidada, gerando novos frutos e crescendo em direção a novos caminhos, tanto para mim, quanto para meus clientes. É tudo uma questão de bonsai, ou melhor, de bom senso 😉 Douglas Faria Marcas de uma vida Portfólio de marcas de mais de 25 anos de carreira 20 anos de Melancia Design Meus agradecimentos Sou Douglas Faria, designer gráfico, publicitário e advogado. Posso me considerar um cara de sorte, pois em toda minha carreira e, principalmente, desde 2002, quando a Melancia Design foi fundada, pude trabalhar em parceria com profissionais talentosos e dedicados, aos quais serei sempre grato: Vicente Calfo (co-fundador), Vera Zunino, Carla Costa, Julia Faria, Eder Silva, Luciana Mendes, Bruno Braga, Charles Rocha, Tamires Tas e Lucas Vianna. Desde 2002, a Melancia Design vem oferecendo design gráfico “de bom gosto”, com foco em identidade visual. De forma resumida, meu trabalho é: Fazer sua empresa aparecer Agregar valor à sua marca Ressaltar seus diferenciais competitivos ""O logotipo muitas vezes é chamado simplesmente de logo, embora esta abreviação lhe tire justamente uma característica fundamental: ele é necessariamente composto por letras (tipos)."" Maria Luísa Peón “É com a carroça andando que as melancias se ajeitam” Ditado popular “Se você acha que o bom design é caro, você deveria ver o custo do design ruim.” Ralf Speth “Os detalhes não são um detalhe. Eles fazem o design.” Charles Eames Anterior Próximo Vamos trabalhar Pra começar, quero saber mais sobre seu projeto Nome E-mail Empresa Local Objetivos Público-alvo Projetos de seu interesse Identidade visual (marca/logotipo + papelaria e outros templates) Impressos para divulgação (projeto gráfico para catálogo, folder, folheto/flyer, banner, cardápio, capa de publicação) Digital (templates para redes sociais) Enviar Desde 2002 Instagram Facebook Esse site utiliza cookies para personalizar sua experiência de uso, ao navegar você concorda com nossa Política de Privacidade .

Dépannage en atelier Lorsqu'il s'agit de réparations matérielles, par exemple pour une réparation d'une écran plat TV ou moniteur, le matériel sera rapatrié en atelier.

Don't worry - the quality of the text will not be compromised in any way.

Clumsily translated scientific terms can leave a drastic and bad impression, and bring confusion and misunderstanding, so always opt for a certified translation with us because we have translators with vast knowledge in a specialized field. Another advantage of certified translations is that the division of labor within the team is done in accordance with a narrowly professional specialization. This means you will get an accurate and authentic translation of your valuable documents.

Among the translators, in addition to foreign language professors, there are highly educated foreigners who have been living and working in our area for a long time, but also our experts who have spent many years abroad and now use excellent language skills combined with specific professional knowledge. The precondition for a person to become bilingual is not enough, but it is necessary to be an excellent connoisseur of language and language structures. Also, translations of some documents can be used in courts of justice or abroad for incorporations, marriages, or divorce. Translations, authentication before government offices, or legalizations before CONSULATES in Toronto is our specialty; in consequence please don't worry, we will take care of it. No translation is too small nor too large, for individuals or companies. Every document is treated with confidentiality. We feel that clients want to speak to real people face to face rather than to a computer or a voice recorder - the personal touch. At Canadian Translator, you deal directly with us. We personally will help you to resolve any questions or concerns that you may have. Our code of ethics is honesty, quality, client satisfaction, punctuality, and trustworthiness.

Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3.

Young and old can juggle one dart after another under the guidance of our qualified Instructors, a safety-focused lesson that lasts about 2h, at the end of which you are sure to feel more than satisfied and a little more warrior-like.

Изготовили ее для нас в ткани, которая была под заказ, т.к нужен был определённый цвет. Все выполнено четко, и качественно, не только снаружи, но и внутри. Есть отличный бельевой ящик, дно съемное, крепится к основанию на липучки, что очень удобно. Сзади у изголовья предусмотрено место под плинтус, благодаря чему кровать свободно ставится вплотную к стене. При выборе кровати обошли немало компаний, но именно здесь нам понравилось все до мелочей в исполнении мебели! Наш заказ выполнили четко в срок, ребята собрали все оперативно и качественно.

Posted on 10/01/2025 19/01/2025 by Martin-El “ H i Martin, Below is a first look link to our live script reading performance of Superman Reborn, the unmade 5th Christopher Reeve Superman film. There was a third draft of the story that leaked on the Internet many years ago however that was not the draft that we used. What was utilized was a never before seen first draft that was signed off and intended by producer Ilya Salkind and writers Mark Jones and Cary Bates. It also features a live Q&A with the producer Ilya Salkind and screenwriter Mark Jones. This is what was performed and recorded in Hollywood November of last year. It is currently unlisted. We are officially picture locked and are scheduled for a world premiere of Monday January 13. Here is an exclusive first look for you . Enjoy and feel free to share with whoever you think might be interested in viewing it first before anyone else. Hope you’re doing well and stay safe out there. – David Kocher Posted in Superman V , Supermania , Uncategorized Leave a Comment on Reborn, Reborn..! Alternate Universe Toys, Inc… Posted on 30/12/2024 30/12/2024 by Martin-El I t’s Christmas morning, 1978. It’s 5am and you just can’t sleep another wink so you gingerly open your bedroom door and start down the stairs in your pyjamas. The welcoming smell of Turkey in the oven hits your nostrils and your excitement goes up another notch. In the kitchen, your mom spots you, smiles, rolls her eyes and whispers “ Just wait for your Dad” before heading back up the stairs. And then its just you, staring at the tree in the lounge with its mesmerising coloured lights and at its base, two small mountains of wrapped presents. There’s thumping down the stairs as now your sister is awake, with Dad following close behind. You wait patiently while sis tears past you, diving right into her pile. “Okay, go ahead” says Mom . Dad takes a seat on the armchair while you kneel down next to the tree and grab the first one, tearing at it in a frenzy. You draw breath when you see its a Dinky Eagle Transporter from Space 1999 . You grab another, bigger this time – seconds later the paper’s off and you’re holding the Star Wars Escape From the Death Star board game with mouth agape. Then its three Star Wars figures wrapped together. Greedo, Hammerhead and Han Solo . Just when you think life couldn’t get any better, out pops the Palitoy Superman figure from the movie dad took you to see only a week ago… Sadly, this is where I always wake up. It’s not as if we were completely deprived – the Mego Pocket Super Heroes Superman was a solid addition to the toybox at the time, (with its short cape and metallized ‘S’) pitched against assorted Star Wars aliens and winning every time. The 12″ Mego Worlds Greatest Super Heroes were, for me, much better, just because they looked more like their cinematic counterparts. But even as a kid, you got the sense these weren’t actually from the film in the same way the Star Wars toys undoubtedly were. The reasons for this, of course, are well-known now, with litigation going back for decades only recently settled to the point where the above description may have been a reality. Indeed, many fans in the US are currently reliving their childhoods this Christmas courtesy of McFarlane Toys , who have just released their fully-licensed Superman: The Movie 6″ Action Figure (which I will be reviewing in a future post!). Back in ’79 though, this was only a minor issue as the Superman sequels, would surely present the opportunity for an official line of figures? Were it not for Kenner’s Super Powers line in 1984, fans would have been outraged, but as that line produced arguably the greatest Superman figure of all time, even die-hard fans of the movies were placated, but never truly satisfied. No Surprise then, when us GenX kids came of age and means, that we sought to plug childhood gaps. A strange phenomenon to be sure, and while the psychology of this is best left to professionals, when talent yields results that make many people happy, it shouldn’t be underestimated or overlooked – And that’s where my good friend Chris King comes in – and take it from me, he’s the personification of talent devoted to making people happy. In the 20+ years I’ve known him, he has endeavoured, time after time and project after project (and at great personal expense), to fulfil these childhood shortfalls and create the toys we were cheated out of as kids. A lifelong sci-fi fan and collector, Chris decided to make for himself the collectables he always wanted but never got – starting with Flash Gordon – another seriously under-merchandised movie. Where were the figures in 1980? How could there not be a toy of Flash’ iconic Rocket Cycle? Cue years of research culminating in both fully realised versions as if Palitoy and Corgi had released both a playset and die-cast model respectively – complete with accurate period style packaging. Want more? How about a set of Viewmaster reels indistinguishable from the tie-ins from the era? The advance of 3D printing over the last decade or so presented no end of possibilities – now you could actually make things vintage toy companies never had the vision to produce. Chris idea was simple – take a long-expired manufacturer and revive it with not only the Star Wars toys they never made, but any franchise in the Kenner style. KennerByKing is now one of the most popular shops on Etsy with an enormous range of cardbacks available for figures either of your own creation, or more recent re-releases. The Superman figure shown above was a special, limited commission by Chris never intended for sale, just to offer a tantalising glimpse into an alternate universe for Christmas 1978… Posted in Super-Art , Super-Collectables , Super-Figures/Statues 1 Comment on Alternate Universe Toys, Inc… Version 3.0..! Posted on 15/12/2024 15/12/2024 by Martin-El WELCOME TO SUPERMANIA/CAPEDWONDER EUROPE (3.0!) T hank you for joining me for this special re-launch of the site to coincide with the 46th anniversary of the release of Superman: The Movie in cinemas..! Its hard to believe that its been 14 years since the debut of this small, yet ambitious blog dedicated to the Christopher Reeve Legacy. In that time we have come full circle from multiple re-releases of the classic films in differing formats, new opportunities to view them on the big screen (as they were meant to be seen!) live concert performances across the world and now, with the release of SUPER/MAN: The Christopher Reeve Story, the closing chapter of our heroes tale. Or so it would seem – as meanwhile, through this site and many more, we strive to keep the memory of the Real Man Of Steel alive, none more so than capedwonder.com – where sitemaster Jim Bowers has carried the torch for over 20 years with the blessing of the late Richard Donner himself. With such pedigree and dedication it seemed almost inevitable that CW and SUPERMANIA would combine our strengths at some point, and with the formation of Capedwonder Europe a few years ago the site’s future was secured. Jim would go one better to form the Capedwonder Network , uniting SuperFans from all over the globe, with representatives from Canada, South America and the Philippines, with more to come. Capedwonder Europe’s evolution over the years has been the gift that keeps on giving thanks to its loyal fanbase and support as I gained new followers on my expansion to YouTube , Instagram , and most recently, the Facebook group Restore Superman IV (a topic which continues to cause controversy to this day!). Its also been a privilege to meet so many fans in person courtesy of Alexei Lambley-Steel’s SUPEREVENTS UK , where we hope to present more exciting opportunities in the future. Now that CWE has upgraded to the same server as CW, it hopefully should be free from all of the glitches and security issues that plagued it previously – so please update your browsers and get ready for all-new super-content going forward into 2025 and beyond! Thank you for taking the journey with us. We remain, as ever, all part of the same team. – Goodnight! Martin L.

He described the fleeting and fickle nature of time— that it seemed to go faster the older you get, and that it usually slowed down to a leisurely, agonizing pace during the worst experiences; conversely, and with seemingly cruel intent, it would accelerate to dizzying speeds, in which the increased velocity was directly proportionate to how enriching a particular experience might be. Despite the existential weight of his imparted wisdom, his reassuring tone allowed my young, frantic mind to narrowly perceive the finer points: time speeds up when you’re happy, and slows down when you’re miserable. Unsurprisingly, and in typical juvenile fashion, I dismissed his prophecy until it became impossible to avoid. So, here I am, at nearly 40, all too aware of the passing of the ages; clinging to the comforts of remembrance, and anticipating the coming phases with something between intrigue and dread. Add to that a standard amount of uncertainty and wavering confidence, I oft find myself seeking comfort in reliable, familiar things: ideals, principals, kindness, MUSIC, memories, inspirational figures and characters, and the singularly rarest phenomenon of fiction and figure merging in synchronous resplendence. My wife Samantha recently pointed something out to me— the occurrence of a nearly unconscious but conditioned, self-soothing technique that I seem to have been utilizing for years. She entered our living room and beheld me, in my sluggish, pajama’d splendor, sitting upright in my creaky recliner. A nightcap in my hand, fixated intently on the screen of our television, I was absorbing the concluding scene of my favorite film of all time: ‘Superman: The Movie.’ Onscreen, the Prison Warden, clasping the railing of his balcony, and observing the sudden delivery of America’s most nefarious real estate mogul, asks ‘Who is that, Superman?’ The proudly defiant Lex Luthor snatches the convincing wig off of his bald head, and proclaims ‘Lex LUTHOR! The greatest criminal mind of our time!’ At this moment, Sam smiles and asks me ‘What’s wrong?’ ‘What do you mean?’ I reply, perplexed. ‘Did you watch the whole movie, or did you just put on this scene?’ She responds, with a knowing, maternal timbre. I smile. ‘Just this scene.’ She begins to nod her head. ‘You only put THIS SCENE on when something is bothering you.’ I made a feeble attempt to seem incredulous; but there was no use. As she asked me that simple question, I began to conclude and concur with her empathetic implication: in times of stress, anxiety, sadness and confusion- without fail, I put on the last scene and closing credits of ‘Superman.’ In concurrence with Sam’s suggestion, I had indeed staggered through an emotionally overwhelming day, and had arrived home feeling utterly defeated. And, true to form, in need of a most affecting and thorough rejuvenation— I put on ‘Superman,’ and skipped right to the final scene. And I did so instinctively. And what happened as a result? The same thing that happens, unfailingly, every single time: I felt a sense of true, untarnished patriotism as Superman admonished the Warden to hold captive the lawbreakers until their due process is satisfied; I grinned and chuckled as Luthor’s luckless crony, Otis, proudly echoed the proclamations of his sardonic lord and chief; I felt the pride and admiration of the Warden as he turned his glance directly to Superman, staunch and resolute. ‘This country is SAFE again, Superman. Thanks to YOU’ he proudly declared. I concur wholeheartedly. His gratitude is MY gratitude. Capping the exchange with humility, and unconditional servitude, Superman cheerfully replied ‘No, sir. Don’t thank ME, Warden. We’re all part of the same team.’ After nearly 39 years of watching this timeless epic, this particular line always lands with profound impact. And with a last ‘good night,’ the trumpet calls and reprises the eternally triumphant and invigorating fanfare, for the ascension of the most literal embodiment of the Super man. The fanfare plays, Superman descends and smiles at me, and the credits roll to the end while the music cleanses my spirit. And with that, I am restored. Tranquil, content, and inspired. Superman has saved me once again. I can imagine that, for those of us who behold the life and work of Christopher Reeve with reverence and gratitude, a story like this probably rings familiar. Though seemingly scattered throughout the world and with great distance between us, we have all shared the memories and moments in which Chris himself, as Superman, or the myriad of flawlessly embodied characters, has profoundly impacted our lives. Regarding Superman, some of us were children when he saw him fly for the first time, while others were well into adulthood. Yet, despite the difference in age, the collective impact appears to have been identical. For example, I vividly recall the moment in which I first saw Superman catch the falling helicopter with one hand, halting its rapid descent, and lifting it back to the rooftop. I was 8 years old, sitting on the bottom bunk in my bedroom, watching the scene unfold on a tiny screen from a VHS cassette recorded off of HBO. Having essentially watched the Superman films in reverse order, it occurred to me in this moment that I may well have saved the best for last. My jaw dropped, my eyes widened, and I remained awestruck and still until Superman’s first night had concluded. Over the years, I have communicated with like-minded fans, who described having similar or identical reactions to this particular moment. Like me, a few of them were children at the time of their viewing; however, others among us were well into their 20’s or 30’s when they first saw it; likewise, they too reported having felt overwhelmed and awestruck by this and other scenes in the film. There was great affirmation and validation in learning that so many others had been affected in the same ways I had been; but equally powerful, was the conclusion that this movie—this Superman—this MAN, transcended any possible barrier of age, station, or circumstance, in the reach and profundity of its impact. How was/is this possible? Well, on its surface, that’s easy to answer: Christopher Reeve. But what is it about Chris’s portrayal of this hallowed character, that burrowed into our subconscious minds, and keeps us coming back to him over and over again? Why is he OUR definitive and forever Superman—and moreover, what is it that seems to make him MORE our Superman, even than the comics from which the character originated? Before Chris was cast, the most recent onscreen portrayal of Superman came from the 1975 televised revival of 1966 Broadway musical, ‘It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane, It’s Superman!’ Superman was played by stage and television actor, David Wilson; perhaps, due in part to the year of its inception and a certain television series based on another famous DC comics character, this show leaned heavily into the comedic and campy corners of the material. That’s not a criticism per se, but it did seem to unwittingly prepare the world for a considerably ‘hard reboot’ for Superman, in terms of the collective public perception of the character. And so, with the arrival of ‘Superman: The Movie’ in 1978, the world was introduced to the version of Superman that it may well not have known that it needed: at face value, a most perfect physical incarnation of the now 40 year old character, seemingly haven risen straight out of the pages of the comic. Revolutionary special effects produced a version of Krypton that maintained a subtle sense of late 70’s futuristic aesthetic aspirations, and wholly unique and brilliantly realized technological marvels. For the first time in the history of live action media, Superman convincingly flew. And he didn’t just float, hover, or gradually find his mark. The man bent his knees, launched himself into the sky, made sharp banks and turns, and landed gracefully with a sense of casual instinctiveness. In other words, Chris’s flight seemed as natural and authentic as a brisk stride. He performed acts of superhuman strength, from catching a bullet to lifting the San Andreas fault back into place. These are basics. Incredible, awe-inspiring basics, to be sure. But these are just some of the boxes checked for the wide audience—children and adults who were ready to see the Man of Steel come to life, and live up to the high standards of pulp fiction that made him less than a god, but more than a man. There were, however, in the very foundation of Chris’s performance, transcendent and everlasting qualities; the essence of truest humanity that people often come to believe isn’t possible to achieve. These qualities, which seem clear and obvious to me now, weren’t so readily perceived when I first became attached to this Superman. At least, not consciously. That is to say, the most personal and authentic miracle of Christopher Reeve’s Superman was the gift of revelation— seeds planted of such pure and abiding kindness, selflessness and servitude that gradually transmogrified into bright, blooming flowers; stunning to behold, and impossible to deny. Revelation- enrichment and understanding, much like gaining the trust of one admired. When that perfect trust is received and reciprocated, partings and reunions become congruent with the sensations of leaving and returning home. Therefore, for me, and many, many others, I suspect that returning to the Splendor of Chris’s Superman is akin to coming home. To the surrogate father who honored HIS fathers and mothers, and whose example we strive to follow. To the impartial lover of humanity, who cared as much for a little girl and her cat as he did for Lois Lane. The hard worker whose dedication to truth and justice shone radiantly and equally— as an immigrant, a citizen, a journalist, and a protector. The available friend who answered the call of world leaders, after answering the letter of a concerned and faithful child. To put it slightly more simply, Christopher Reeve elevated the strength of the PERSON of Superman, to the position of a relevant, morally steadfast role model. For all humankind. Chris’s personal values, wisdom, and example have become permanently fused with, and amplified by those of the mere CHARACTER of Superman; and because of this momentous union between a real human being and a fictional icon of virtue, Chris truly, actually became….. Superman. The real, LITERALLY real, Superman. The real merges with the mythic to become, miraculously, mythically, real. I can think of no other instance in history, in which such a phenomenon has occurred. With the help of dear Chris, Superman has evolved from a fictitious legend, whose values we strive to uphold, to a legendary person, who embodied and justified those values. He lived among us, walked in our shoes, and showed us all what it really means to be Super. How blessed we all are, to have actually seen it happen. — James Walker (Illustration by KIBAR) Posted in Super-Art , Supermania , Uncategorized 1 Comment on 72… “Eight O’Clock, He Says…” Posted on 21/04/2024 21/04/2024 by Martin-El I ts been way too long since I posted in general, but what with the continued success of the YouTube Channel, Instagram account and Restore Superman IV campaign, its fair to say Capedwonder Europe has never been busier – That said, SUPERMANIA is where it all started and its high time I got back to what made the site so unique in the first place, the showcasing of rare and unique artefacts exclusively from the Superman Motion Picture Series. And what a great little addition to the collection the above has proved to be – While not the original prop, this UK made & sold TIMEX Gold Ladies dress watch is the exact make & model worn by Margot Kidder in her role as Lois Lane (see portrait above courtesy Jim Bowers ) Notable for its few seconds of screentime in closeup, this prop opens the pivotal ‘Balcony scene’ where the intrepid journalist is poised to get the story of the century. Presumably obtained by the Wardrobe Dept. in 1977, this tiny, elegant timepiece was a very popular style at the time, with its pearlescent face, windup feature and metal strap. While specific details are scarce about the watch itself, it seems plenty were manufactured back in the day and can still be obtained in good condition for a reasonable price. I couldn’t resist the temptation to pair it with the awesome replica Library card replica w/envelope (beautifully rendered by Daniel Sanchez ) for the perfect ‘I spent the night with Superman’ display (sans wine & Marlboro’s!).

user.poste-lta.34-102-108-236.cprapid.com,1,en,0,64,"Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works Apache2 Debian Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows: /etc/apache2/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf . The default Debian document root is /var/www/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different to previous releases which provides better security out of the box. Reporting Problems Please use the reportbug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Debian. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to respective packages, not to the web server itself."

We may notify you of significant changes to this policy. Your rights In this Section 5, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. Your principal rights under data protection law are: the right to access; the right to rectification; the right to erasure; the right to restrict processing; the right to object to processing; the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and the right to withdraw consent. You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is: consent; or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.

Read more Frequently asked questions Why am I getting moles in my 30s? Typically, all the moles and freckles we will develop in our lifetime appear during our childhood. It is possible to develop new benign moles after the age of 30, but you should get everything new checked out by a doctor as a safety precaution, because new moles after 30 have a higher chance of being malignant (cancerous). Where can I find a skin cancer clinic on the Gold Coast? Conveniently located on the Gold Coast in Tugun, the Gold Coast Skin Centre is located at 3 Boyd Street, just 5 minutes from the NSW border. If you are arriving by car, entry via 1 Tugun Street is best. What are the three types of skin cancer? The most common type of skin cancer in Australia is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The second most common skin cancer type is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The third most common is melanoma. There are other types of skin cancer such as merkel cell carcinoma, but these are rare. How curable is skin cancer? Skin cancer can be successfully treated and cured if detected early enough. Most early skin cancers can be removed with minimal harm to the patient. More advanced skin cancers can be difficult to remove and may cause disfigurement and scarring. Deadly skin cancers like squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma can spread to other organs and require much more significant treatment such as radiation therapy and major surgery to prevent death.This is a rare occurrence if the malignancy is diagnosed and treated early - which is why skin cancer checks are so important! What is basal cell carcinoma and what does it look like? Basal cell carcinoma is a malignancy of the basal cells in the skin, usually caused by damage from UV exposure. A BCC can sometimes look like an open sore that won't heal, a red patch of skin, a pink growth, a shiny bump or nodule that sticks out from the skin, or even a blister. Basal cell carcinomas can ooze or bleed, and can become itchy or crusty.

If you're driving traffic to a website that has an unguided shopping experience, then you're wasting marketing spend and killing your profits. Instead, you can quickly boost results by driving traffic to a guided funnel that takes shoppers from click to checkout. It's like the shopping experience at Ikea vs one of Walmart's retail stores. Shopping at Walmart is distracting, overwhelming and frustrating. In comparison, Ikea's shopping experience is a guided funnel. You're seamlessly driven from visit to checkout, and discover relevant products you never knew you needed, along the way. I don't know about you, but whenever I've shopped at either them, I've always ended up with more in the cart at Ikea!

Amendments We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes to this policy. We may notify you of significant changes to this policy. Your rights In this Section 5, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. Your principal rights under data protection law are: the right to access; the right to rectification; the right to erasure; the right to restrict processing; the right to object to processing; the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and the right to withdraw consent. You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is: consent; or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.

Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Issue Over facebook and google in india Recently As we all know, that the supreme court of India has asked many social networking sites to remove all content which are Unexpectable by our Indian society.. many people are making fun of our social leaders,cricketers, politicians, social workers and many people this is not good in good sense. ofcourse it can be good for some peoples to take revenge and also to make fun.anyway our court has raised good point, i really appreciate our supreme court. Everything have two sides. by looking at all these things, court has given order to social networking sites to remove all anti-social, anti-religious, disrespectful contents.This action by our court is taken for more then 22 sites. court has given time limit upto 6th february to the social networking sites to give reports to court about what actions are taken by them to stop these sort of things. i hav few examples which are reallly bad.this i am just posting not for fun, just to show everyone that its not good Look at this video and image that created by peoples . Court had given high pressure on both google and facebook to wanting to block obsence contents. lawyers of google and facebook agreed that blocking certain keywords that realated to the word ‘obscene’ will limit the internet. “There is a civil parish called Penistone, in England. Blocking all content with this keyword would mean that residents of this parish might never figure on internet,” said a Facebook lawyer. This is what the fun making of people with the great indian cricket playar bad.this i am just posting not for fun,------------------------------> all these are shameful so court has taken its some strict decisions hope we should stop these fun which can hurt someone's respect Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share How to Access Facebook without Internet Connection India has estimated 34 million registered Facebook .To expand its roots more deeper into rural areas and to strengthen its current user base Facebook has partnered with Fonetwish for free access to Facebook accounts without Internet connection.Now you access Facebook even with stone age phones like Nokia 1100 which even don’t have Gprs facility.

Have a look at screenshots below for step by step guide. That’s it! This is the New Year gift from the Facebook to the Indian users. Note:-This service is currently available on Airtel, Aircel and Tata Docomo (India) & XLcom, Telkomsel (Indonesia). Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Simple 4 things to be secure your facebook account in 2012 In the last year December 7th the facebook founder Mark zuckerberg private photos were leaked to other photo sharing site later facebook identfied that the flaw was by a recent code change and the flaw lived only short limted time. its afecter many users including zukenberg ""Hackers are using more sophisticated methords and spammers sre for emails. Facebook users need to take extra precautions and exercise better judgment to ensure their accounts and their personal information stay safe. Here are important four ways to do. 1. Enable SSL Encryption. In my privious posts Browse Facebook On A Secure Connection (Https ) i exaplained the methord and advantage of using HTTPS over an HTTP . to enable this security feuture go to account settings page. chose security tab and the side you can do either disable or enable this encryption feuture When enabling HTTPS some of third party application may not allow and the page loading performance will be less than noraml becuse we are using secure connection instead of unsecure connection. 2. Use App password for your applications. App password are tempararry passwords that used to login to your applications without the need of providing your original facebook password. to get an app password, go to your Account Settings--> Security tab--> Click ""Edit"" in the Generate an app password window you can enter anything that you like its just for a feuture reference then you done. when using a facebook app please review the behaviour of the particular application before granting the permission to acces your profile like wall posts by app also check my privios post about New Facebook Application Spreading That Completely Steal Your Account. 3. Consider to Log Out from your account when you are leaving. If you are decided to go for an outing then dont forget to log out from facebook it will prevent from "" like jacking "" and many other such threats. Likejacking is a form of clickjacking or malicios methors that will lead to users like a website article or a website link as a status update without the intension of the user to ""like"" the thing. For an example recently users hit by a click jacking attack that read """"LOL This girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE,"" and, ""This man takes a picture of himself EVERYDAY for 8 years!!"" after clicking this link user take into a suspicious page that contain a clickjacking worm that automatically post links on the users wall. 4. Be Careful what information you share about you. Some of your information are very usefull to hackers for example your birthday if you pu somthing realted to birthday in your security question that will make advantage of hackers to find the answer of the security question of your any account Posted by Unknown Tweet +1 Like Share Ramnit' worm infects 45000 of Facebook account Recently Facebook has hit by a worm called "" Ramnit "" which has stolen facebook account credentials of 45000 thousands users and so on after login into users account it strting to spread malicious link through walls we identified that attackers behind the Ramnit worm is using stolen credentilals like stolen passwords. the onother fact of this attackers advantage is that millions of users are using same password fro diffrent accounts like google+ , facebook, twitter, linked in, yahoo to gain remote access to corprate networks a Facebook rep told ZD Net.

itvopen.net,1,en,0,73,"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: /etc/apache2/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod , a2dismod , a2ensite , a2dissite , and a2enconf , a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different to previous releases which provides better security out of the box. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to respective packages, not to the web server itself."

co-djs.com,1,en,6,195,"Welcome Toggle navigation Home About Us Services Contact Us Galleries Photos Videos Central Oregon DJs DJ services for your wedding, party or other event... we can provide anything from a mobile ""pop-up"" DJ to a full-blown Dolby Atmos setup with intelligent lighting! Our DJs range from 18 to 70+ and can give you music in any genre from the 1950's to today. Who We Are We're a local, family run Central Oregon company. Three generations of DJs with varying musical tastes guarantee that the music played will be by someone who actually lived through that era/genre (and still lives in it today). Although our core staff are father-son-grandson, we have extensive connections and can provide you with whatever personality of DJ you're looking for, offering any genre of music you could possibly request The DJs Our Core Team John (DJ OlDÅÅd): music of the 1950s-1960s-1970s Brandon (DJ Dunie): music of the 1980s-1990s-2000s Wyatt (DJ Akila): music of the 2010s-present Angel (DJ King Ese): Hispanic music, QuinceaÃ±eras The Music The Best Quality We use a professional DJ service with over 110 million songs and over 650,000 music videos... music quality ranges from 5 times the best bitrate available for an MP3 up to the original studio masters (for many titles) The Equipment Portable Excellence Our systems are designed to be small and portable but deliver MASSIVE performance (like Beldar's bottle rocket in Coneheads)... our ""little"" system sometimes gets requests to turn down the subwoofers. We now have a battery-powered mini PA system (300 watts/channel with bluetooth + wireless mics) Music even where there's no electricity - like a beach party - no noisy generator required ! Available DJ Packages We custom-tailor your DJ(s) and equipment to the specific needs of your event... from small and informal to major productions. All prices for the packages below are based on a 4-hour gig (no charge for setup or takedown)... overtime is billed at $100/hour, but if you know your event will last longer than 4 hours, arrange for a longer gig in advance and we'll negotiate a price that works for everyone announcement ""Pop-Up"" DJ Package: $500 Folding DJ booth: stereo 2000 watt PA. Small system is compact enough to fit in a space about the size of a sheet of plywood and sets up quickly. Karaoke, video & lighting packages are add-ons (extra cost) aspect_ratio ""Full"" DJ Package: $750 Full DJ booth: 3.1 channel 3000 watt PA & lighting on a truss (RGB mini-PARs, UV lights, LED strip lights, moving-head lights, lasers, hazers, fog machines), Includes Karaoke and dual 55-inch TVs check_circle ""Everything"" DJ Package: $1250 True Surround: 7.2.2 channel 5000 watt Dolby Atmos system on towers surrounding the room or dance floor. Includes Karaoke, dual 110-inch projectors + screens & additional lighting on all surround towers vertical_split Karaoke Add-On A 32-inch tripod-mounted monitor for the lyrics and four wireless mics: $50 (free with Full/Everything) Our online Karaoke service currently offers over 60,000 titles, with 400+ new songs added monthly! vertical_split Video/Lighting Add-Ons Dual 55-inch TVs: $75 (free with Full) Dual 110-inch screens: $150 (free with Everything) Mini lighting pack: $75 (2 stands with LED strip lights, UV ""black"" lights and 2 moving-head lights) supervisor_account NEW! ""Party"" Package: $250 Two 300 watt speakers w/ subs and three wireless mics. DJ runs playlists from an iPad rather than a booth... perfect when all you want is background music with minimal space taken up by equipment But wait... there's more! We're sure you have other questions, and this section is designed to answer as many of them as possible Can I use my own playlists? Absolutely... we can convert playlists from over 125 streaming services: Tidal, Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, Apple Music, Amazon Music (Prime, Unlimited, Unlimited HD), YouTube, YouTube Music, iTunes, SoundCloud, Napster, Last.fm, Discogs, Shazam, Billboard, LiveXLive, Plex, Emby, Qobuz, Anghami, iHeartRadio, Rekordbox, DJUCED, Serato DJ, Beatport, Beatsource, Roon, JioSaavn, Gaana, Audiomack, Mixcloud, Traktor, Mixxx, Playzer, Musixmatch, Hype Machine, 8Tracks, Setlist.fm, Dailymotion, Jamendo, NetEase Music, Moov, MTV, Primephonic, MusicBrainz, SoundMachine, Windows Media Player, Groove Music, Bluesound, Dj Pro 2, Garmin, VKontakte, Yandex Music, Zvooq and others. Can I use my own pictures, videos, powerpoints and other media? You bet! We'll need them in digital format so they're easy to import into our DJ software. You can email them... send cloud service sharing links (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive, etc)... provide them physically on a USB thumbdrive, CD, DVD or BluRay disc... send us links to YouTube/Vimeo or other videos... if it's music, though, we strongly suggest you send a playlist from your favorite streaming service so our conversion software can up-convert the actual music files to FLAC or MQA quality for better sound. How do you handle payments? We ask for 50% down when you reserve your event date (not refundable, but can be applied to future gigs should you need to change the date, cancel due to weather, etc.) and the balance at the completion of the gig. We take cash, check, credit/debit cards, ApplePay, PayPal and Zelle. Do you take requests? That's entirely up to you... some people don't want their guests requesting random songs, and would rather we stick to their pre-determined playlist. But we bring a large selection of pre-saved playlists for all genres AND have a live cloud connection to over 110 million songs and over 650,000 music videos (we bring our own cellular-based Internet router), so it would be unlikely that you could request a song that we don't have. We use an online request app that allows you and your guests to send requests direcly to the DJ booth by simply typing: ask.the.dj into your phone's browser and selecting ""Central Oregon DJs"" (you can go there now, but it's only ""live"" during gigs). How do we get started? Once you have a venue selected, we will meet with you at the venue to see what we have to work with, We''ll want to know what we will need to bring that's not included with the venue. We'll also want to get to know you and what you want to see happen... what you DO want to have happen as well as anything you DON'T want (as far as music, lighting or other technical areas). Download our Venue Checklist using the link below. This is a printable PDF form we'll be using as our checklist to make sure there are no surprises on the day of your event... we recommend you print that out and go over it. The first page lists what we'll be looking for as far as our technical needs... the second page lets you know exactly what we'll need from you AT LEAST a week before the event and the final page lists our standard packages and costs. Once you've looked the venue checklist over, contact us and let us know when we can meet with you at the venue for an initial walk through. From that point forward, we'll be in touch regularly via email, text and phone. Venue Checklist Home Page About Us Services Contact Us Photo Gallery © Copyright by Central Oregon DJs"

Located in a developing town of Kolhapur; in south western Maharashtra, we established a foundation in 1996; with a vision to provide a turnkey solution to people & organizations working in the field of developing & building roads. Roadsâ¦ keeps us moving on & on. With the help of Active Software Consultancy & Research Pvt. Ltd.âs time tested solutions such as âActive Roadâ & âActive Bridgeâ; be sure that it fulfils your entire road & bridge execution requirements. We are not the only players in this sector. Yes; but we assure the best quality product with numerous facilities in an affordable cost. The backbone of our software is of course our esteemed customers. After almost 20 years in the field of Civil Software Development, we dedicate each & every up gradation to our customers who supported us to walk further along with adds on facilities. Now after a walkway of 20 years, we are proud enough to facilitate our customers with a full fledged software; up graded to the latest requirements in national & international market.

Confident enough to stand in domestic & international market. After our journey of merely 20 years; and consistent development; we are here with two appropriate softwares. One for the road and other for the bridge. The road Girish Arekar, a man, in fact an ordinary man with average intelligence, after completing his diploma in civil, working as a civil draftsman in a small organization was inspired with an inquiry from local contractor. It was regarding designing a plan to build a new road. Girish took that enquiry in a different way. He began to think it to make easily; with some software tool. But it was not available. This unavailability of software was the beginning of his software company. Meanwhile he started coaching of MS office to manage his livelihood. Simultaneously he continued to develop his dream project. In 1999; after working for 11-12 months software was ready to install. After consistent efforts for many months, in 2001 the software was appreciated & purchased by a road contractor in Konkan. Then onwards, many prestigious names were added in to the clients list. With more than 350 satisfied customers all over India; the software today facilitates its customers with utmost options in designs & calculations related to roads & bridges. The first turn Warna engineering college; a famous educational institute in south west Maharashtra being a technical adviser & consultant of PMGSY (Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojana) was in search of related software. The chief of Warna asked this requirement in an open market & published a tender notice. Many national & international software companies submitted their products. Among all, the core technical team selected our software considering its simplest user interface, easy accessibility and proper output. This was the first turn when our company was marked in local & national market. Since then, till this date we never looked back and went on installing our product locally & nationally.

(You can copy drawing file for plotting anywhere). Formation width may vary (may be left and right separately) will accepted. There is facility to take different slopes for Carriage and shoulder (Camber). You may give different slopes for inner or outer side of gutter, different heights & widths for left and right gutter. You can easily change filling as well as cutting slopes. (If you have no slopes but have a meeting point i.e. distance & RL of null point it will automatically calculate the slopes). If you have both RLs (GRL as well as FRLs) then also it calculates area between them. You can easily shift the center-line left or right by giving the specific distance. You can easily mark a new formation line on L-Section (in CAD). it will automatically Calculate the 2. grades (slopes) and accordingly that it will take FRLs to every chainage.

mamasewingcircus.com,1,en,4,321,"mamasewingcircus.com mamasewingcircus.com Just another WordPress site per square mile August 6th, 2011 Interesting infographics showing how much space the 6.9 billion people in the world would occupy if the world’s population lived in one city. (Each info graphic represents the population density of a different city.) Posted in life | No Comments » things that fall through the night while you sleep August 5th, 2011 A few years ago I blogged about the NASA Asteroid Watch mailing list. Those bright guys at NASA would email you when an Asteroid or space debris came within sight of the Earth. Yeah, this ranks up there with the antigravity pen in terms of ideas to come out of NASA that weren’t so brilliant. (I’d prefer sirens.) Anyway, now there’s an app for that. But if you’d rather hear the news via email, at least this newsletter seems more complete. Posted in life , science | No Comments » find your ideal doggie match June 7th, 2011 Take or upload a photo and cutting edge modeling software will find your doggy match. Very serious business. http://www.doggelganger.co.nz/ Posted in Uncategorized | No Comments » there’s always a cheaper way April 12th, 2011 Apparently someone is selling fake eggs in China. At 360 eggs per chicken per year, 2 feet of space required per chicken, and the tiny feeding requirements of each chicken, I just can’t see how manufacturing fakes would be cost effective. ChinaHush, a website in mainland China where fake eggs are believed to have first originated, suggests the following for consumers to identify fake eggs. 1. After cracking the fake egg, the white and yolk will mix together quickly. 2. Fake eggs have slightly shinier shells than real ones. 3. The shells of the fake eggs feel slightly rougher. 4. You will hear sloshing sounds when you shake a fake egg as liquid will flow from the solid agent. 5. Real eggs smell like raw meat. 6. Tapping a real egg lightly will generate a crisp sound when compared to a fake egg. 7. When frying a fake egg, the yolk will spread without being touched. Read for yourself. Some people are creeps. Posted in Uncategorized | 1 Comment » this is really how the french do it April 3rd, 2011 Spurred on by my mother laughing that I was probably baking a loaf of fresh french bread while I was flambéing the lobster shells for our weekly lobster bisque one Sunday afternoon (I wasn’t), I was motivated to find an easy satisfying baguette recipe that would fit into our weekend routine. Now several months later I’ve figured out how the French have their bisque and fresh baguettes, too. We trialed this recipe: bread in five minutes a day I baked up a quick baguette in the early afternoon to sample the recipe. It was the perfect shape, excellent birdseye, with a moist crumb. A perfect baguette made with minimal effort. After sampling half of the original loaf, Doug suggested I make a second loaf for dinner. I’m saving the other two loaves for later in the week. Try it. It is kind of like finding an extra few hours in the week.

Posted in Uncategorized | No Comments » reading dogs March 1st, 2011 Acquisition of literacy skills is of particular interest to me as the mother of a bright but incredibly active little engineer and a stereotypically precocious younger daughter. So, I perked up when I read about the Reading Education Assistance Dogs (READ) program . Troubled readers are paired with dogs with sweet dispositions who lay next to them while the children read aloud. The thinking is that reading to a non-judgemental audience, like a dog, is a less threatening way for a troublesome reader to gain confidence in his skills at reading aloud. If nothing else, I figure this is superior to reading to your 4 year old sister with good deductive language skills who yells the correct word at you as you struggle to sound it out. Posted in kiddos , reading | No Comments » shibboleth February 24th, 2011 My how times have changed since I was in first grade. My first grader has moved on to using a calculator in class to manipulate large numbers. As any dutiful parent would, at night I’ve been coaching him at the 362 words he can concoct using shibboleth, the (perhaps, lost?) language consisting of the 10 letters one can symbolize using the crude numbers on a standard calculator. Come on, admit it, even you laughed at 5318008. (For the kids at the front of the classroom, turn the face of the calculator upside down to read “boobies”) If you, too, have a first grader, want to get a jump on 1st grade curriculum, or want to take a trip down memory lane, there are some gems, here.

Fue creado en un momento en que el diablo se había levantado contra la Iglesia de Dios, causando que muchos cayeran de su camino de rectitud. En 2014, la población del reino de Dios en muchas partes de Europa se había reducido a la mitad en los primeros meses. Incluso el cuerpo de creyentes tuvo que pasar por mucho. Para algunos, ir a la Iglesia se convirtió en un problema y el crecimiento espiritual se había hundido profundamente. El fundador de este sitio web y su Familia tuvieron que pasar por el mismo problema. Siendo un cristiano con sus sentidos espirituales abiertos, identificó que hubo un ataque espiritual a la Iglesia a través de métodos tecnológicos avanzados. Siendo guiado espiritualmente, emprendió un viaje para llevar el Evangelio de Nuestro Señor Jesús predicado por pastores de todo el mundo a un lugar donde pudiera ser fácilmente accesible a un costo gratuito.

ACD BRAGA – LEILÃO SOLIDÁRIO A Associação Columbófila do distrito de Braga, no passado dia 28 de Março 2021 transportava cerca de 10.000 pombos num trator que sofreu um violento despiste na A2 – zona da Marateca – destruindo aquele veículo articulado. Com efeito, a galera onde se encontravam acondicionados os pombos é passível de ser sujeita a reparação profunda, já o trator que o compunha foi dado como “perda total”. Ora, como é do conhecimento geral, esta Associação não tem fins lucrativos, e possibilidades financeiras de suportar os custos necessários. A aquisição do novo trator e a reparação da referida galera, só serão possíveis com o gesto solidário de pessoas singulares e colectivas, que habitualmente apoiam este desporto, designadamente de todos os columbófilos, que muito bem sabem das dificuldades sentidas na obtenção de apoios financeiros que permitam assegurar a continuidade desta modalidade apaixonante. Nestas circunstâncias decidimos promover, com o apoio da Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia, um leilão solidário, que nos permita angariar fundos de forma a minorar os custos que esta Associação terá de suportar no futuro próximo. Apelamos, assim, à participação de todos no Leilão Solidário que se realizará nos próximos dias 12 a 17 de Agosto de 2021, no qual poderão participar de duas formas: Através da oferta de um borracho para que seja leiloado no leilão on-line no site da F. P. C. Quem não pretenda oferecer qualquer borracho, poderá sempre licitar os borrachos que serão colocados a leilão.

Com o recente comunicado da FPC do dia 21 de Janeiro acerca do adiamento da competição para o primeiro fim-de-semana do mês de Março e do adiamento da prova nacional de Valencia del Cid para 22 Maio 2021, vimo-nos forçados a ajustar o já aprovado calendário desportivo. Também a realização de treinos (particulares e coletivos) é permitida desde que se cumpram as regras estipuladas, a saber: Proibição de utilização das instalações e estabelecimentos das coletividades. Proibição da utilização de espaços fechados bem como a permanência de mais do que um columbófilo no mesmo local, ainda que ao ar livre. Continuidade na utilização dos meios de proteção individual e coletivos (máscara, lavar ou desinfetar as mãos com frequência e promover o distanciamento social) bem como manter desinfetados os instrumentos, superfícies e veículos em uso. IMPORTANTE: Utilizem espaços ao ar livre para a entrega dos pombos nos treinos. Vamos todos demonstrar responsabilidade e respeito pelos outros. Por tudo, a Direção e Conselho Desportivo da ACD Porto reuniram ao longo dos dias 21 e 22 para encontrar um calendário alternativo que apresentará à FPC. Em simultâneo, e como entidade organizadora do Internacional Norte, contactámos as restantes associações para acordar as datas das provas do referido campeonato pelo que, desde já, agradecemos o rápido entendimento, empenho e abertura de todas as associações que, mais uma vez, demonstraram clareza, sempre com o objetivo de proteger e valorizar o pombo-correio. Com uma breve explicação, apresentamos as alterações ao calendário desportivo da ACD Porto e que esperam a aprovação da FPC. Alteração dos dois treinos oficiais para 20 e 27 de Fevereiro; Adiar a primeira prova oficial para 7 de Março; Iniciar o campeonato com apenas uma prova de velocidade, permitindo que as provas de fundo se mantenham nas datas previstas; Passagem do concurso de Valencia del Cid para quarta prova de fundo e escolher Minglanilla como terceira prova de fundo; Realizar unicamente o concurso de Barcelona/Igualada no primeiro fim-de-semana de Julho, permitindo uma preparação adequada para a prova e promovendo assim o pombo-correio e a igualdade entre columbófilos. Não podemos, mais uma vez, deixar de enaltecer o trabalho, dedicação e coragem dos órgãos sociais das coletividades que são o motor da força e da vontade fundamentais para a columbofilia. Estamos, como sempre, disponíveis para esclarecer e ajudar nos mesmos moldes do passado. Contamos com a dedicação e responsabilidade de todos no cumprimento das regras básicas amplamente divulgadas no nosso dia-a-dia, para que a columbofilia seja vista, praticada e vivida exemplarmente, garantindo o nosso futuro e o futuro da modalidade. “…Sê a mudança que queres ver no Mundo…” Mahatma Gandhi CALENDÁRIO DESPORTIVO REMETIDO À FPC PARA APROVAÇÃO Iº Campeonato Borrachos 2020 Organizado em parceria com o Grupo Columbófilo de Alfena Mapas de classificação GPCcolumbófilo GPCpombo Às Penela 3/10/2020 Penela 3/10/2020 Pombal 10/10/2020 Pombal 10/10/2020 Penela 16/10/2020 Penela 16/10/2020 Pombal 24/10/2020 Pombal 24/10/2020 Leiria 31/10/2020 Leiria 31/10/2020 Geral Columbófilo Geral Pombo Às Prova Final Viana do Alentejo (4.º para pombo Ás) marcada para Sábado – 26 de setembro 2020 .

Este ano a prova final não poderá ter habitual assistência como consta no Regulamento para a prática desportiva na columbofilia – COVID-19 “ARTIGO 11º – Presença de público 1. A presença de público nas competições desportivas é determinada pela legislação em vigor, sendo atualmente proibida a sua presença.” 31-AGO-2020 – Solta Fátima (2.º para pombo Ás) – soltos às 08h45 pode acompanhar a chegada neste link 25-AGO-2020 – Solta Condeixa (1.º para pombo Ás) – soltos às 10h20 pode acompanhar a chegada neste link Derby ACD Porto 2020 13-AGO-2020 – Treino Albergaria – solta prevista 8h45 pode acompanhar a chegada neste link 03-AGO-2020 – Treino S M Feira – solta 9h25 CHEGADA Assembleia Geral 27 de julho 2020 O calendário aprovado para a época desportiva 2021 da ACD Porto foi a Proposta B . Votação: Proposta A : 13 votos | Proposta B: 18 votos | Proposta C: 5 votos | Brancos/Nulos: 3 Notas Explicativas Propostas de Calendários Desportivos 2021 Proposta A – Actual com ajustes Idêntica ao actual calendário 2020, tendo sido modificados somente alguns locais devido à impossibilidade da realização das mesmas nas condições ideais. Proposta B – Idêntica à proposta A mas com alteração das duas primeiras provas de Fundo Foram substituídas as duas primeiras provas de fundo para Baena e Albacete – Linha Sueste. Proposta C – Especialidades Este calendário representa a evolução necessária para a columbofilia local, regional e nacional. Permite criar a elite amante de fundo e grande fundo sem prejudicar a competição contínua dos restantes amantes do nosso desporto. Os amadores e as coletividades podem optar por escolher realizar apenas uma, duas ou todas as especialidades. A adesão dos sócios e das coletividades ao campeonato de fundo poderá ser menor. Assim sendo e de forma a centralizar os encestamentos para fundo, a ACD Porto decidirá com acordo das coletividades os locais de encestamento, como exemplo a recente prova ACD Porto 3+ de La Muela. Apesar de estarem evidentes as especialidades com 8 provas de Velocidade, 8 provas de Meio-fundo e 6 de Fundo, é possível manter a classificação geral com as provas de 6+6+6 para cada especialidade, já definidas (G) idênticas ao calendário proposto na opção A ou B, juntando apenas mais 2 provas de velocidade e de meio-fundo aquando o 1.º 2.º 4.º e 5.º espanhol, provas que apenas contam para as classificações da sua especialidade a nível de Zonas/Blocos. O campeonato de leste “Zona D” está disponível para qualquer colectividade do distrito. Em todas as 3 propostas mantêm-se como objectivo efetuar/celebrar o dia da columbofilia com a designação ACD Porto 3+ onde se pretende realizar três provas distintas das diferentes especialidades. Pretende-se também manter o campeonato internacional norte.

Agradecemos a todos quantos se inscreveram nas três provas e, a esses, prometemos voltar em breve com iniciativas parecidas que permitam que nós, columbófilos, possamos sentir a columbofilia mais exacerbadamente. Que Minglanilla seja um palco que nos permita, de alguma forma, esquecer as vicissitudes deste 2020 e que acicate o apetite para um 2021 positivamente diferente.

De seguida, gostaríamos também de enaltecer os columbófilos do distrito do Porto pela massiva inscrição naquela que queríamos como nossa primeira prova de Fundo do ano. Infelizmente, até à data, não recebemos qualquer autorização de solta em Espanha, o que nos leva a ter de cancelar a prova de Minglanilla, calendarizada para o próximo fim de semana 07/06. Para que todos se possam regozijar com os números, a título informativo, adiantamos que foram inscritos 11026 pombos para supra citada prova… Notável! Enquanto aguardamos notícias das autoridades espanholas, informamos que no dia 07/06 faremos as provas de meio-fundo agendadas para 14/06, calendário B, a recordar: Zona 1 e 2 – Almodôvar Zona 3 – Messejana Zona 4 e 5 – Ourique Os horários de encestamento e os horários de concentrações serão os mesmos das provas de meio-fundo. A nossa promessa é a de vos manter informados acerca das negociações com as autoridades espanholas e, assiduamente, faremos todas as anotações, ajustes e ponderações que nos permitam praticar a nossa Columbofilia nesta “nova normalidade”.

Por denúncia, interpelação, pedido de esclarecimento ou outra manifestação qualquer, a Secretaria de Estado da Juventude e Desporto e o Instituto Português do Desporto e Juventude, receberam, nos últimos dias, alguns contactos de columbófilos, denunciando, interpelando, pedindo esclarecimentos ou manifestando dúvidas quanto à retoma da prática columbófila. Daí, resultou um comunicado do IPDJ que proibiu/suspendeu a vertente competitiva da Columbofilia. A Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia refutou a decisão das entidades supra mencionadas apresentando uma série de argumentos baseados em alicerces legais e aguarda uma resposta do Gabinete Jurídico do IPDJ que permita desbloquear a situação. Todas as associações distritais estiveram, ontem, 07 de Maio, em reunião de carácter urgente, de onde resultou o comunicado federativo. A Columbofilia não parou, podemos treinar os nossos pombos, encestar nas nossas colectividades, imprimir as nossas listagens. Tudo se mantém no Porto, mantemos o nosso calendário, mantemos as nossas provas. No Porto, viveremos ainda dias de glória e prazer e veremos chegar os nossos alados dos locais que calendarizámos. Para já, sem carácter competitivo, em modo de treino. Depois, quando tudo resolvido, já em vertente de competição. Tudo será resolvido em breve! Não desanimamos nem queremos o vosso desânimo! “Sê a mudança que queres ver no Mundo” (Mahatma Ghandi) Comunicado FPC Comunicado da ACD Porto Após reunião com a FPC a ACDPorto esclarece. Está autorizada a retoma da prática da columbofilia em território nacional a partir de 4 de maio; Reiniciaremos a época desportiva no dia 10 de maio com uma prova gratuita de preparação/treino; Enquanto aguardamos pela autorização de soltas em território espanhol , daremos continuidade aos restantes campeonatos das zonas 1,2,3,4 e 5, ficando a 6 condicionada. Assim, conjuntamente com a zona 6, tentaremos encontrar as melhores alternativas, divulgadas oportunamente; Relembramos que é impreterível o cumprimento de todas as regras das Medidas Gerais do Plano de Contingência COVID-19 elaborado pela FPC, sob pena da interrupção da campanha. Comunicado da ACD Porto Reunida a estrutura columbófila nacional a 21 de Abril de 2020, cumpre-nos: – Informar todos os Columbófilos que até à data de levantamento do Estado de Emergência, p.f. 03 de Maio, as Associações, Coletividades e Columbófilos não podem fazer treinos; – Informar todos os Columbófilos que a Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia tem estado em contacto permanente com as estruturas governamentais portuguesas e espanholas no sentido de, mal seja possível, podermos retomar a prática da Columbofilia dentro de uma nova normalidade, já conhecida e aceite por nós; – Pelo feedback que tem obtido por parte das entidades governamentais portuguesas, pensa a Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia conseguir autorizações de solta em território nacional, nos dias úteis imediatos ao levantamento do Estado de Emergência; – Pelo feedback que tem obtido por parte das entidades governamentais espanholas, pensa a Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia conseguir autorizações de solta em território espanhol, nos dias úteis imediatos ao levantamento do Estado de Emergência em Espanha e à Abertura das Fronteiras de e para o mesmo país; – É do entendimento geral que a Columbofilia só poderá retomar a prática, caso toda a estrutura columbófila siga escrupulosamente as normas sociais de proteção. Após o enunciado, informamos: CÓDIGO DE COMPORTAMENTO – A Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia, em conjunto com uma empresa certificada na área da “Higiene no Trabalho”, elaborou um Manual que reflecte todos os procedimentos que teremos de adotar em todas as operações: Preparação do Encestamento; Encestamento; Carregamento; Entrega de relógios; – A ACD Porto, ciente desta necessidade e com o intuito de minimizar investimentos adicionais das coletividades, ofererá às equipas de encestamento o material de proteção necessário – Máscaras, Luvas, Gel Desinfectante, Aventais ou Batas; – A Federação Portuguesa de Columbofilia distribuirá pelas Associações algum material de apoio, nomeadamente viseiras. NORMAS TRANSITÓRIAS – Do entendimento da maioria, resultou um documento que suspenderá alguns artigos do Regulamento Desportivo Nacional, permitindo assim que: . Campeonato Nacional de Fundo – Contarão as 3 melhores provas de 4 possíveis; . Campeonato Geral – Caberá às associações e às colectividades a adoção do Campeonato Geral. CAMPANHA DESPORTIVA Algumas notas, a seguir: – Os locais de solta das provas de velocidade e meio-fundo serão, se possível, os já atribuídos a cada Zona; – Na eventualidade de podermos fazer Fundo, reformularemos os locais de solta. O número de provas de Fundo será calculado após termos autorização para entrar em Espanha; – A Zona 6, com um concurso em atraso, poderá ser susceptível a mais alterações e os ajustes serão feitos oportunamente, consoante as possibilidades. Entenda-se mesmo que o primeiro concurso a efectuar, poderá ser em data diferente das demais zonas. Aliás, a impossibilidade de soltas nas províncias de Castilla y Leon, Comunidade de Madrid e Andaluzia, obrigarão a ajustes em todos locais de solta de velocidade e meio-fundo; – Caso não tenhamos oportunidade de realizar provas de Fundo, ajustaremos o calendário consoante e promoveremos outras provas dentro de território nacional; – No que concerne à Zona 6, caso não exista alguma possibilidade de soltar em Espanha, promoveremos algumas provas de velocidade obedecendo à mesma linha de voo. Esperamos que o presente comunicado tenha sido suficientemente elucidativo e prometemos voltar com informações concretas, mal existam. Estamos atentos, estamos convosco desportiva e socialmente e, acima de tudo, passamos por esta situação tal como todos vós! “ Sê a mudança que queres ver no Mundo ” (Mahatma Ghandi) COMUNICADO DA ACDPorto Depois de anunciadas as medidas de restrição de toda actividade columbófila e após reunião com a FPC, estiveram reunidos os órgãos desta associação, pelo qual desejamos esclarecer o seguinte: – A total proibição da prática da actividade columbófila foi imposta pelas entidades competentes. Assim, pedimos a todos que cumpram estritamente estas medidas emanadas pelas entidades públicas. – Tais medidas, sabemos, são por vezes difíceis de entender pelos amantes da columbofilia, mas são do interesse da saúde comum. Sabendo-se que grande parte dos praticantes da modalidade tem uma idade avançada (seniores), deveremos assim apontar as nossas medidas para os colegas mais vulneráveis e ajudá-los a saber como agir e se comportarem nesta situação delicada. – Sabemos também que os C. Desportivos /Técnicos das colectividades merecem toda a nossa atenção pois são em grande parte o motor para o retomar da prática columbófila. Ora, pensando também nesses colegas, já encetámos contactos com empresas certificadas na procura de fatos e viseira de protecção. Tudo faremos para as podermos disponibilizar, pois estamos conscientes que é estritamente necessário respeitar as medidas de segurança no interesse de todos nós. – Informamos que logo que sejam anunciadas novas medidas de flexibilização na retoma da prática desportiva, a ACDPorto iniciará as devidas e necessárias diligências, afim se permitir o regresso ao nosso tão desejado e amado desporto. (de onde se inclui treinos individuais, colectivos e provas oficiais). – Por fim, reiteramos o nosso empenho na enunciação de medidas de apoio aos columbófilos tendo em conta todos os cenários possíveis, as quais serão implementadas assim que oportuno. – Ate lá, PEDIMOS A TODOS, por solidariedade, que sigam estritamente as medidas impostas. – PALAVRAS DE ORDEM – AGUARDEM COM SERENIDADE ” Sê a mudança que queres ver no Mundo ” (Mahatma Ghandi) Declaração de Localização de Pombal Os Columbófilos com pombos recenseados que, no âmbito das duas deslocações, necessitem atestar a localização do seu pombal, poderão emitir uma Declaração de Localização de Pombal , através do Portal do Columbófilo. Essa declaração inclui a identificação do Columbófilo, o número de pombos recenseados, as coordenadas do pombal e a morada do mesmo, obtida por georreferenciação reversa, assim como um código de síntese que permite a terceiros verificar a integridade do documento. No caso em que os pombos estão inscritos em nome de uma sociedade, a declaração deverá ser emitida através da licença da própria sociedade, designando um dos sócios constituintes como sendo o titular da declaração. Caso o Columbófilo não se possa deslocar ao pombal e deseje delegar o tratamento dos pombos noutra pessoa, poderá redigir uma declaração nesse sentido. É disponibilizado no Portal do Columbófilo um modelo de declaração de tratador que poderá ser utilizado para o efeito. “À Direcção da FPC têm chegado manifestações de cepticismo relativamente à possibilidade de poder vir a ser retomada a Campanha Desportiva. Não acompanhando este sentimento, a Direcção da FPC dá nota que é sua firme disposição tudo fazer para que, o mais rapidamente possível, se faça o regresso à competição columbófila. O quadro previsto pelas autoridades sanitárias não contraria a nossa vontade, e mesmo perante um eventual agravamento das previsões, consideramos ainda assim, existirem condições para prosseguir a campanha após o interregno.” ( ver aqui todo o comunicado ). SERVIÇOS CONDICIONADOS Desde o primeiro caso de coronavírus em Portugal que a Associação Columbófila do Distrito do Porto esteve atenta ao desenvolvimento da situação, implementando medidas de prevenção para evitar ao máximo por em risco os nossos amadores, colaboradores e as suas respetivas famílias. Tendo atenção a estes fatores decidimos condicionar o acesso as nossas instalações, partir das 18h00 do dia 18/03/2020. Assim, qualquer assunto pode ser tratado por vias alternativas, e-mail: geral@colomboporto.com a qualquer hora do dia ou por telemóvel para o número 919 901 403 no horário das 10h00 às 18h00. Os pombos do nosso Derby terão durante este período todos os cuidados necessários. Esta não é uma medida fácil de tomar, mas necessária. A segurança e saúde de todos os que nos são próximos estão acima de todos os fatores. Continuaremos atentos à evolução dos acontecimentos, certos que todos tomaremos as devidas precauções e que retomaremos a nossa actividade o mais breve possível. Esperamos a compreensão de todos. COVID-19 – Suspensão de Provas e Treinos Tendo presente os últimos desenvolvimentos relativos à epidemia provocada pelo vírus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) e considerando a enorme responsabilidade que sobre todos recai de contenção da sua propagação e de protecção da saúde de todos, atendendo às medidas que vêm sendo diariamente anunciadas pelo Governo, as quais, em alguns casos, causam restrições inultrapassáveis à prática da nossa modalidade, a Direcção da Federação Portuguesa de Columbófila, após consulta e em decisão concertada com todas as Associações Columbófilas Distritais, comunica a decisão de suspensão temporária de todas as actividades desportivas columbófilas até ao dia 6 de Abril de 2020 , não se realizando, assim, treinos e provas de pombos-correio até ao referido dia.

Ready to become a successful crypto investor? Fill out a simple form and start now! Complete Registration By signing up, I consent to and acknowledge the Website's terms of use and Privacy Policy . Automated trading and investing with SmartBitBoost Ultra – a new trend in the crypto industry Crypto exchanges and various wallets are gradually becoming obsolete, giving way to something much more practical—a technology that until recently seemed amazing and fantastical. You’ve probably guessed it; we’re talking about SmartBitBoost Ultra—a new revolution in the field of investments and automated trading. This platform not only allows investing in established and emerging promising cryptocurrencies but also enables automatic trading with artificial intelligence, providing a high level of efficiency and ease of managing your assets. You are probably interested in how all this works. In simple terms, our artificial intelligence was specifically designed and fine-tuned to work with cryptocurrencies. It analyzes all fluctuations in the crypto market, taking into account various informational events, and carefully predicts the rise or fall in prices of any given crypto. Thanks to this analysis, users can profit from price differences, which is particularly important in the context of trading. As for direct investments, with the help of SmartBitBoost Ultra’s artificial intelligence, you can completely delegate the management of the crypto purchasing process. How to Begin Using SmartBitBoost Ultra? It’s quite simple. First, you need to apply for an account creation. To do this, fill out the form available at the top of the website. Second, prepare the funds necessary for purchasing crypto using AI. The minimum deposit amount required to activate your account is 250 $ . Why this amount? It is necessary for the AI to function properly, enabling it to purchase the right assets at the right time. If the deposit amount is lower, the volume of operations will be too small, significantly reducing their efficiency. Why Crypto is Your Best Investment Choice In the world of investment, there are numerous options: gold, stocks, futures, bonds. However, crypto stands out because of its high volatility, which, in skilled hands, can yield incredible returns. With SmartBitBoost Ultra, returns can reach up to 460 percent per month, and that’s not even the limit. You can always enable the reinvestment feature to reinvest your earnings, significantly increasing your monthly profitability to an average of 1100% from the initial deposit. As for asset diversity, our artificial intelligence works with more than 3000 different cryptocurrencies, ranging from well-known ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to various meme coins. It’s worth noting that the latter often turn out to be one of the most profitable ways to earn, as little-known coins can bring in thousands of percent in profit. Our AI decides what and when to buy, adding a coin to the list of potential investments at the development stage when the first mentions appear and then making a purchase when it is fully confident in the coin’s growth. Get started with SmartBitBoost Ultra How does the SmartBitBoost Ultra AI know how to act correctly? You’ve probably heard buzzwords like algorithms and machine learning. These aren’t just empty terms. To ensure our AI reached an accuracy of around 95%, we began its training long before the platform’s release. This AI has undergone numerous successful tests, learning from real examples and memorizing various behavioral patterns. In other words, we traded many cryptocurrencies in real time, experiencing both successful and unsuccessful moments. The main goal was to show the algorithms how to act correctly in different situations, not only to avoid losses but also to earn profits. The very first version of the AI contained over 100,000 different simulated situations, and now this number has exceeded 1,000,000. Thus, our SmartBitBoost Ultra AI knows how to act correctly based on a vast amount of data and scenarios, allowing it to make the most effective decisions in the highly volatile crypto market. In addition, the SmartBitBoost Ultra system includes several key features that contribute to its high accuracy and efficiency: – Market behavior analysis: The system continuously monitors and analyzes the actions of other market participants to better understand current trends and sentiments. – Adjustments based on external information: The AI makes changes to its strategy based on data obtained from external sources, provided they are deemed reliable. This allows the system to quickly adapt to new conditions. – Adaptation to market conditions: The system can modify its actions depending on the situation in the crypto market to minimize risks and maximize profits. All these factors ensure the stated accuracy and functionality of SmartBitBoost Ultra. No experience with cryptocurrencies? No problem, use SmartBitBoost Ultra ! We often fear jumping into the unknown, which is understandable, as it initially always brings some discomfort. The same goes for cryptocurrencies; understanding how it works requires a lot of effort, energy, and an incredible amount of motivation. Signals, long, short, Pump and Dump, ICO, HODL, and dozens of other confusing terms are now in the past, because the era of artificial intelligence has arrived. We can rightfully call ourselves revolutionaries in this field, as such functionality did not exist before our market entry. This platform is your golden ticket to a wealthy and easy life. With SmartBitBoost Ultra, you no longer have to delve into the complexities of trading and crypto investments, as the system will do everything for you. This represents the future you can already touch and utilize to generate a stable passive income. All you need to do is create an account, deposit at least 250 $ , and start the process. You can either invest in crypto for the long term or trade using AI simultaneously. Ideally, a larger budget is recommended in this case, as the initial amount will be proportionally divided. Nevertheless, everything you earn from trading can either be saved or reinvested. How you proceed is up to you. By default, the amount will not be reinvested, so you need to remember this and configure the system according to your preferences. Starting the AI is simple – just log in and click the start button, which becomes available immediately after activating your account. SmartBitBoost Ultra is a platform you can trust! Nowadays, the internet is filled with numerous platforms that promise you the world without any real foundation. In the case of SmartBitBoost Ultra, we can confidently attest to its effectiveness in real-world conditions. The platform has undergone numerous audits by independent companies, has over 5,000 active users, and the total turnover of all funds exceeds 3 billion dollars. We have earned the trust of our users with a reliable service that not only generates income but also serves as a valuable partner for storing your crypto assets.

Personial coach en voedingsdeskundige Jurgen beX Als nieuwetijdskind, geboren in de jaren tachtig, werd ik al van jongs af aan geconfronteerd met duisternis, wat mij de nodige uitdagingen in het leven heeft bezorgd. Deze ervaringen gaven mij de kans om als een padvinder op zoek te gaan naar de juiste weg in mijn leven en het licht en de kracht in mezelf te ontdekken. Dit pad heeft me ook doen beseffen dat natuurlijke verbondenheid essentieel is voor de mens. Iets wat we verleerd zijn, maar wat we niet kunnen negeren.. Lees meer Meer dan enkel en alleen voedings- en welzijncoaching Natuurlijke voeding en mentaal en emotioneel welzijn zijn nauw met elkaar verbonden. Het begrip ‘je bent wat je eet’ onthult veel meer over onszelf dan we ons vaak bewust zijn. De keuze van voeding kan gerelateerd zijn aan ons gemoed, en fysieke klachten kunnen een psychosomatische betekenis hebben. Vanuit deze standpunten kunnen we een op maat gemaakt plan voor jou samenstellen.

Deze rode draad geeft je de mogelijkheid om te vertrouwen dat alles wat op je pad komt goed is voor je eigen ontwikkeling. Zo kom je te weten waarvoor je bent geboren en wat je hiervoor nodig hebt. Echt jezelf zijn In onszelf zit een diep brandend verlangen dat vraagt om aanwezig te kunnen zijn.

Frequently asked questions about health insurance What is health insurance? Health insurance is a plan, or policy, that covers a percentage of doctors’ visits and hospital bills. It helps offset the costs of both planned and unplanned medical needs. Medical care can be expensive, but health insurance may help lessen the financial burden. And health insurance isn’t just for when you’re sick or injured. It can also help you stay healthy through preventive care and wellness programs. This may help you save money, too, by catching potential health concerns before they become larger issues. How does health insurance work? Health insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company (the insurer). When you purchase a plan, you become a member of that plan. Each month, you’ll likely pay a fee, called a premium, to use the plan. There are many different types of health plans, but they generally work the same way. You pay for some medical costs and your insurer pays for some costs. How those costs break out depend on your specific plan benefits and coverage. Learn more about how health insurance works How do I get health insurance? Finding the right health insurance plan depends on a variety of factors. These include things like your age, health and financial situation. For example, if you’re over 65 or have a qualifying disability or special situation, you may be eligible for Medicare . If you have a lower income, you may qualify for Medicaid . If you want to purchase an individual plan, an Affordable Care Act (ACA) plan could be an option. Or, you may have the option to get health insurance through your employer . Most health insurance plans have a special period of time, usually once a year, when you can enroll. This is called open enrollment. It’s when you can start, stop or change your health plan. Timing of open enrollment varies based on the plan. Learn more about open enrollment What are the different types of health insurance? There are a variety of health insurance plans that fit different needs. Some plans are offered through the government, like Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans, Medicare plans and Medicaid plans. There are also health plans you can get through your employer. Or, you can purchase a plan on your own, like short term health insurance that offers coverage for a limited amount of time. Understanding the different health insurance options can help you find the plan that may work best for you. You may also see terms like HMO, PPO, EPO and POS ­— these refer to the four basic kinds of provider networks that certain health plans may offer. A network may include doctors, hospitals and other providers that agree to provide services to plan members at a negotiated rate. This may help lower your out-of-pocket costs. Learn more about the different types of health insurance How much does health insurance cost? It depends. A variety of factors impact how much you pay. These can include your age, your location and lifestyle habits. It also depends on the type of plan you choose. With some plans, you may pay less up front, but more when you receive care. For other plans, the opposite can be true. Learn more about health insurance costs What does health insurance cover? Coverage is unique to each health plan. Many plans may cover things like preventive care, prescription drugs, hospital stays, mental health services and more. A plan may cover the full cost of certain services, or you may have to share costs (by paying a copay or coinsurance, for example) until you meet a deductible or out-of-pocket limit. Make sure to review benefits and coverage before choosing a plan. You can find this information in the plan’s Summary of Benefits and Coverage. This is a document that all health plan companies are required to provide. It outlines what’s covered, partially covered or not covered under a health plan.

UgPass The traditional reliance on passwords and passcodes is now braced with security challenges as well as end user fatigue given the increasing trend of digital services. As a result, user identities cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Whereas it is estimated that the introduction of online services by GoU has simplified access to services and saved over four million working hours, users still have to physically go to GoU offices to sign documents in order to complete some of the more complex transactions. This has proved to be a huddle to the rollout and adoption of e-services, that otherwise would be in high demand. There is a need to for a secure channel for identification of users as well as the use of advanced electronic signatures based on a chain of trust.

Hyderabadi Biryani is the kachay gosht ki Biryani or the dum Biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. Lucknowni or Awadhi Biryani is a pakki Biryani. The rice and meat are generally partially cooked separately in spiced water, then layered and cooked by the dum pukht method. Kolkata Biryani is much lighter on spices and uses potato & egg to enhance its flavour. It is a sub variant of Lucknowi style of Biryani.

CONOZCA LOS FUNDAMENTOS DE LA INVERSIÓN! El primer paso para comenzar tu viaje de inversión es entender qué son las inversiones y qué tipos existen. Trade Reo Pro te guiará hacia algunas de las mejores compañías educativas en el campo de la inversión, donde ya tendrás los conocimientos básicos. ¡Empecemos! ¿QUÉ SON LAS INVERSIONES? Las inversiones son cuando un activo, en el que inviertes, genera ganancias con el tiempo. Solo controlas el proceso, dedicando el mínimo tiempo. Invertir es colocar dinero en activos como bienes raíces, acciones o negocios, con el objetivo de obtener beneficios. Ayudan a aumentar tu patrimonio y asegurar la estabilidad financiera. Generalmente, dividimos las inversiones en: desarrollo personal, bienes raíces, acciones, metales y negocios. Por ejemplo, invertir en conocimiento y habilidades te convierte en un empleado valioso. Comprar bienes raíces para alquilar proporciona ingresos estables. Muchos inversores esperan el «momento adecuado» para invertir. Pero es imposible prever el mercado. Es mejor simplemente comenzar y recordar: el tiempo en el mercado es más importante que el momento de entrada. Las inversiones son una gran oportunidad para hacer que tu dinero trabaje para ti, protegiéndolo de la inflación y las fluctuaciones de divisas. Trade Reo Pro te dirigirá a las mejores compañías educativas en el campo de la inversión. Comienza tu viaje de inversión con confianza. OPORTUNIDADES FINANCIERAS: TODOS LOS TIPOS DE INVERSIONES QUE DEBE CONOCER Invertir es un viaje emocionante donde la elección correcta del camino y el momento es clave. Tus inversiones pueden ser a corto plazo (hasta 1 año), a mediano plazo (1-5 años) o a largo plazo (más de 5 años). Cada tipo de inversión tiene sus potenciales beneficios y riesgos. Por lo tanto, es importante que monitorees constantemente tus inversiones para responder oportunamente a los cambios del mercado y aprovechar al máximo las oportunidades. Para invertir con éxito, es fundamental que te informes sobre cada tipo de inversión y evalúes tus capacidades financieras y objetivos. Hemos preparado una lista detallada de los distintos tipos de inversiones para que puedas comprenderlos a fondo. Acciones Poseer una acción significa tener una parte de la empresa. Ganas en la diferencia de precios de las acciones y en los dividendos. Es una herramienta de alto riesgo, pero potencialmente muy rentable. Bonos Los bonos son títulos de deuda emitidos por empresas o gobiernos. Recibes el valor nominal del bono y un ingreso por cupones en un término determinado. Los bonos son menos riesgosos que las acciones y proporcionan un ingreso predecible. ETF (fondo de inversión cotizado) Invertir en un ETF significa poseer una parte de un portafolio de activos que ya está diversificado. Es una manera conveniente de invertir en el mercado sin necesidad de formar un portafolio por ti mismo. REITs (fideicomisos de inversión inmobiliaria) Los REITs son fondos de inversión de bienes raíces. Ofrecen la oportunidad de invertir en el mercado inmobiliario sin la necesidad de adquirir propiedades directamente. Los REITs se caracterizan por su estabilidad y liquidez, pero también tienen sus riesgos. Criptomoneda La criptomoneda es una moneda digital o virtual que utiliza criptografía para asegurar las transacciones. Invertir en criptomoneda puede traer altos beneficios, pero también está asociado con altos riesgos debido a la volatilidad del mercado. Criptomonedas populares como Bitcoin y Ethereum pueden ser una adición interesante a tu cartera de inversiones. EL PAPEL DE LA COMPAÑÍA DE INVERSIONES Y SUS FUNCIONES Aprender a invertir es un proceso complejo, pero increíblemente emocionante. Para alcanzar éxito en tus objetivos de inversión, necesitas un enfoque estructurado para adquirir conocimientos. Aquí es donde una compañía educativa de inversiones puede ayudarte, proporcionándote todos los materiales educativos necesarios. También puede ayudarte una compañía educativa de inversiones, que te proporcionará todos los materiales educativos necesarios.
